you wouldn't because you know there are consequences . it's in those eyes of yours , though ... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work . i won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner . i only took their sins to logical conclusions .
looks okay . i don't see anything .
i wonder if they've - - i don't want to hear anything about it .
nobody's gonna get you . now get inside .
maybe they didn't want it back . maybe the whole fat deal was insured .
the tv ... they want to talk to you ...
wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here .
that machine - -

why colonel green@@ hill is colonel green@@ hill , sir ... commanding officer , fifth u . s . cavalry ... i'm lieutenant green@@ hill , sir .

i'm just flesh and blood , baby . that and a few memories of bad women ; just like most guys . but you already know that . you read my fortune . thanks for the lemonade .
it's not regulation . and the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him , and while he's laughing , you can shove it down his throat .
good morning .
you must open me up again ?
look , look . get your suit cleaned .

ever seen one of these before ?
boy , that is the real south . that is real corn liquor .
he always had a weakness in that area . i saw it the first time i met him . we all had our weaknesses , i guess . daitz wanted the money . with dave it was the glory . koessler saw the behavioral s@@ ci@@ ences unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things . he had his eye on the director's job , even then . catching killers was a means to an end for them .
don't panic .
good question .

you okay , man ?
theyre german jews . came here before the war . they both lost all their families in ex@@ termination camps , but they themselves never went near one . the idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting leon . its not guilt , more of a curse ... and then theres something about his parents being involved with nazi hunters ... but i think thats just one of leons dark delusions ...

no problem .
your princess is really a winning creature . a trifle simple , perhaps , but her appeal is und@@ en@@ i@@ able .

kitchen closes at eight but i'm the night clerk . i can always ring out for sandwiches .
it's not healthy , kafka - - not for you and not for your work@@ mates . at the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance .
that's from your movie , right ? " the only monsters are here . "
maybe you don't know what it's like where mrs . crawford comes from - - but i do . i came from a neighborhood just like hers . this is a whole other world for her . she's a poor working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated and mostly un@@ sympathetic people . so , she puts on her best dress , fixes her hair and tries to present herself as inte@@ lli@@ gently as possible . being poor and having pride is not a crime , mr . dulaney - - and before you attempt to imp@@ each another witness ' testimony in my courtroom - - your foundations better be based on something other than se@@ man@@ tics .
but you were business associates ?
i want my paycheck . by the end of the day .
oh , jesus !
you're a sex junkie , you know that , carl ?

edward bloom .
what , is it the stairs ? christ , i'll let you win next time .
what ?
does the name tex pen@@ tho@@ l@@ low mean anything to you ?
well , there are certain sections of new york , major , that i wouldn't advise you to try to invade .
frederick , why are you so interested in this particular case ?
gotta check up on my boys . hey , what's with the food ? some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver . ' can@@ apes , ' he says . i say , ' can a peas , my ass , that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver .

' , and the wise old bull rep@@ lies , ' no , why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows ? '

i deal with this stuff every day . but a fireman ... you never get used to it . what happened up there ? he was a candidate . did he pay attention ? was he listening ?
cora , in my heart , i know once we're joined , we'll be the happiest couple in england . let those whom you trust , your father , help settle what's best for you . in view of your in@@ decision , why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine ?

you go back , you won't be alone . you'll have a diabetic bar@@ keep cell@@ mate . you're still young enough to have fun shan@@ king child mole@@ sters for a pack of smokes , but " alex " will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral . depressing .
well , in that case , couldn't you - - ?
hmm . it's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and ... is there anyone in the seat next to me ?
when captain went down , you stepped up - - whether you like it or not . now they train you for this , so - -
some people do it for for improvement
it's ok . it's good to let it out .

the right nostril . good .
well ... i've got another project i wasn't gonna tell you about . lugosi's in it , but he's got a smaller part . the lead is an ingenue , a sterling young actress named dolores fuller . the title is " bride of the atom . "
what's goin ' down , son ?
dennis !
later on .
i guess i'll try to back it out on the rim ... at least to the main road .
thirsty .
k@@ z ... 7-@@ 0 ... 7-@@ 0 ... nine . it checks out .
dead as dillinger .
yes .
we could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship . that would kill it .
oh , a baron !
so we'll sell the house .
no .
what the fuck is going on ? when did you get out of jail ?
i don't want to see any more beef j@@ er@@ ky . i mean the next beef j@@ er@@ ky you hand me is going out the window . it's drivin ' me crazy . the whole car smells like it .
no .
she'll drop you . when she's done with you , she'll drop you .
it's as simple as that . you've been on our ward six hours and have already si@@ mp@@ li@@ fied the work of freud , jung and maxwell jones in one grand ana@@ logy : it's a pe@@ cking party .
i can't stay on this planet .
you know what they say . if you have to ask - -
maybe i'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does . or maybe ill snap its ugly head off .
lydia is the girl parry likes ... and i thought , if i could get them together i ...
those are pretty hostile words .
clever fuckers .
i started to get serious about seven years ago .
and are they going to get it ?
and now he works for your government , doesn't he , brad ? he's attached to the bureau of investigation of that which you call u . f . o's . isn't he , brad ?

yeah .
then what are you afraid of ?
maybe two cars .
since when does ellie need moral su@@ pp - -
pra@@ cti@@ sing to be thi@@ ck-@@ headed , you're there already .
' cause this is the co@@ ve he obviously lives in .
you're just comfortable , that's all . you don't even ask to go home . you just lie around , let your mama take care of you .
yes , you did . now that is the question ! that is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves . you tell me fisher . what have we done ?
the same old trouble , leon . you're always late . whether you're taking me to the opera or calling for me at a beauty shop , you're never on time . and now , when it's a question of your reform - - late again . by about five minutes .
maybe he's not supposed to be like you . maybe he's supposed to be just like he is .
they think it's school-@@ related ?
that little shit !
i like working for the bureau , sir . i like catching bad guys . it's all i care about .
i'm busy .
yes .
you work alone , savvy ? you can't handle the job , i'll find someone who can .
if you wish to put things on that basis , then i will say good day to you , monsieur .
we're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity ! damned box !
good-looking , too . like karen .
especially not miss kubelik .
everybody keeps starin ' at me .
oh , shit !
you'll get through this . you were fine for over three weeks .
we will , baby ... all this means is we got the whole island to ourselves .
oh come on . there're lots of girls here who look better than ...
front page ?
yes , i have mine .
fish ... ... bru@@ ssel sp@@ rou@@ ts .
i am concentrating . where can we rule ?
me , too . and very erotic ...
her knee acting up ?

bottom , left , right . i have it .
yes .
where shall we go for dinner ?
the gate has but one key , and i carry that .
oh , yeah ? it's all right with me . go on out in the storm , but i'm going to follow you , see ? yeah . and if you get tough i'll just have to turn you over to your old man right now . savvy ? now that's my whole plot in a nutshell . a simple story for simple people . now if you behave yourself , i'll see that you get to king westley ; if not , i'll just have to spill the beans to papa . now which of these beds do you prefer ? this one ? all right .
co@@ val@@ ent ... right . so ...
i don't care .
oh ! green jack ! what a dream i've had ... proper nightmare .
yes , i think it's brilliant . you've been doing it for years .
i can't believe what you are finding out . are you going to continue with this . are you going back to her apartment ?
wait a minute . i'm not riding in that .
what , sergeant ?
it'll come back to him .
you know what i think about , talby ?
nothin ' .
pay@@ ne .
nothing to it , really . claude figured they could steal a couple of bodies from the morgue . they got a couple of crackers working there don't know their asses from their elbows . then they was gonna set fire to the infirmary and make it look like those bodies was them that got stuck inside . claude figured during the commotion , it wouldn't be too hard to slip onto one of the fire trucks and hang tight until it rolled right on out of here in the morning .
keep your voice down .
you understand what you'll be doing ?
to abraham lincoln .
off a little alley with co@@ bb@@ le@@ stones . hemingway went there ...
yes .
stop what ?
fuck me .
it's been sometime since , uh , i received any , uh , of that kind of , uh ... attention . a couple of ... years .
why ? you have a home here now , if you want it . everyone will ...
you have it with you ?
get to sleep young lady - - and i mean it .
because ... the needs of the one out@@ we@@ i@@ gh@@ ed the needs of the many .
fuckin ' bullshit is right , in'@@ it ?
it hurts . aw , jesus !
you pla@@ y--@@ left field .
but you don't agree ?
huh ?
he wants me to testify ? is that what he's asking me to do ?
first of all -
it's going to be great - -
did you ever sit on the edge of the bed , take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes ?
i guess you got enough today to last a lifetime , huh ?
twenty-@@ one-@@ years-old , ladies and gentlemen ; four of those years spent ac@@ compli@@ shing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning - -
she@@ e@@ sh ! aye aye cap'n !
they've all tried . nobody's got to first base .
that why you came over here , to ask me that ?
that's ignorant .
i want to keep my teeth .
let me give you an example ... sexuality .
oh no , i , i ... eh ... i couldn't .
i don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies .
i know right . it was kinda weak . that's cause will ken@@ ni@@ son only wrote a rough treatment of it . the script was written by some new guy . he wrote arlington street .
wait ' til you get into trouble , just wait .
there's just one more thing i need you to do .
i see . and you are in california for what reason ?
if he says that's what happened , jake , it must be true .
i don't know .
and you were a lamb . as soft as milk .
we've already tried it - - eth@@ yl methane sul@@ fon@@ ate is an al@@ k@@ y@@ lating agent and a potent mu@@ ta@@ gen - - it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table .
einstein . had two marriages , both tra@@ in-@@ w@@ re@@ cks . the guy never saw his kids , one of whom , i think , ended up in an asylum - -
tighter ' n a bulls ass in fly season . don't hit the barn .
yes .
crime of passion . he just went nuts . he would have shot everyone in here . he just ran out of bullets .
i'm not rambling .
what ? ... oh , no , thx . that's not true . not satisfied ? thx , i need you so much .
di , it's lu@@ ce . kansas just called and said she's going to " fuck me up ! " then i heard coughing , a thu@@ d and kansas had to go . i think her grandma had another heart attack . anyway , why does she want to " fuck me up ? "
mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport . you understand ? if you're here - they're not gonna send it . they'll think i'm gonna come out with you .
what are you blu@@ b@@ ber@@ ing about ?
what's the beef ? we're sitting pretty . we get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
would make me feel better about it .
i think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this . maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better .
dont you think thats a little gi@@ m@@ mi@@ cky ?
but your friend is waiting downstairs .
i can't talk any louder . they might hear .
you really think so ?
there's no * real * ship as can match the inter@@ ce@@ p@@ tor .
i don't know what you expect me to know about ... people come and go ...
he told me about this . you got this from containment ?
of course they're cute now . but in a second they're going to turn mean and ugly somehow and then there are going to be a million more of them ! ...
i know you very well , conor macleod . and i can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you . mu@@ let , romirez , they were fools without vision . it was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players .
oh , jesus . you wanna tell me what the problem is here , or - -
if they get over the border , they're gonna let us go .
going back - to the jungle to die .
i say a lot of things .
that's fine , eddie . all in the line of duty .
... don't get all ...
the child !
that would have been quite a coincidence .
they've blocked it !
would you excuse us , please .
you think this shit's funny , ho ?
you don't like seeing people get hurt . now in morality , that is a virtue . in politics , however , that is weakness . you were a hostage to everyone else * long before you were a hostage to
are these all of her pre@@ vi@@ sions ?
rachel's not half my age .
no . not this time , h . b . it's been months since i've had an episode . and you know what ? i'm learning to control it .
no you didn't . you didn't even ask about billy .
sure . i'll just leave ' em with the s . w . a . t . guy answers the door .
then let's act like friends . let's talk . i know this is a new place , and - -
fuck , ok .
we're losing atmosphere ...
gee , i wonder why not .
because you think i'm all like ... " hey man , check me out " .
i been driving ri@@ gs a long time , nick . four , five million miles of road . worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less i was driving fifteen hours a day . tell ' em i needed sleep , i needed rest , shit , they'll hire someone else ...
you got it .
you must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said .
i am . you're not .
and how many people have you killed ?
you know , that's what makes the whole thing so funny . a guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary , everyday , sle@@ w-@@ foo@@ ted plumber - and by the use of a little brains , mind you , he builds up a gigantic institution , emplo@@ ys thousands of people , becomes a great civic leader . and then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had .
was i ever of use ?
you know why i'm handling it very well ? because you're going to get these guys for me .
trickery and flu@@ m@@ mer@@ y or not , she's going there tomorrow on the bus ! it's settled ! and i must say we've been more than fair to you , rose , it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that !
what are you wearing ? i mean , we should wear suits .
yeah ...
i don't particularly want to talk to you .
wanna go to dinner ?
yes , sir , i sealed the room myself . nevertheless - - i am reading a life form there .
we're a team ... my ... talent . your ... mo@@ bility .
tina !
yeah . i don't see a way out of it .
to an asian design major .
... maybe i should just move in here with you ... i could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until i get a job .
i've got a plan . you and val take your truck , get to the mountains . hike to bixby . get us some help .
i know tom grunemann .
goodbye , sandra .
some .
$ 1,000 , 000 .
sophia . hello sophia . mine's still john .
why do you think you tell me , ne@@ ssa ?
the hell is that ? what kind of ' guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her ?
you probably also know that we found them okay .
actually , you're just in time . admiral ro@@ e@@ buck : you know commander bond , don't you ?
so how long am i supposed to sit an ' twi@@ dd@@ le my thumbs in this place ?
it's an interesting one , pete . if anything was going on it's totally subdued now .
rod , i'm not a ra@@ s@@ ci@@ st . i'm telling you to be the best version of you , to get back to the guy who first started playing this game . way back when you were a kid . it wasn't just about the money , was it ?
i gotta di@@ di man . don't wanna miss that chopper . i'll send you a postcard . after i get me some . i'll send you some tapes too man . this new guy jim@@ i hen@@ dri@@ x man , whew ... you okay taylor ? just ' member take it easy now , don't think too much , don't be a fool , no such thing as a coward cause it don't mean nuthin . jes keep on keepin ' on . okay my man ...
so i guess you didn't get away * for the weekend after all ? *
we must be right over the colony . let's get some air support , eh ?
yes .
can't help it . you're doing time for me . no greater love , as the man says . wish you'd tell me why .
smart . hard as hell to handicap . you know what i like ? ha@@ i ala@@ i . fast game . you know why i like it ?
i don't know .
it doesn't have to be . everybody knows that if you mess with the kremlin , you'll end up in a siberian gu@@ lag eating your own fingernails .
you shut up .
you can't threaten me - -
where ?
that's too bad , jeff . well , i guess i can't be lucky every day . forget i called .
sure do ... that's why we didn't bet with the navy .
yeah .
i've got a meeting in chinatown .
as for our plan of action , any@@ body@@ 'd be insane to go in from the ground floor ...
what's her problem ?
whatta you mean ...
i don't need any proof .
which part ?
your life that bad ?
charenton ? the administrator there is quite well-@@ loved , is he not ?
you said speak czech !
how nice . you remembered . but of course , that was the day the germans marched into paris .
water .
you tell me . i'm new in town .
it seemed that way to me .
sally doneghy , now who is that ?
well , we can talk about it .
hear !
ah , forget it , kid . i want you to pull this out of your head . if that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you , goddammit , i will . i respect your artistry and your methods , and if you can't fill us in yet , well hell , we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts .
... - na@@ tic .
not so perfectly if you noticed .
if it's all the same to you , i'd rather not dish right here in the middle of c@@ ran@@ k@@ ville .
you smiled at me .
you just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you .
he's going to kill you . don't you know that ? he can't take the chance that you'll talk .
no , to you--@@ m'sieu <u> monescu </u> .
they were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along . i wrote colonel doolittle , and told him i needed to see you before you go .
tomorrow .
today . and now you - - there's a dog in the van - -
sure is .
how about a lift home ?
what's with you ?
i got money .
and besides , i thought , to hell with it ... it's okay if you only married me for my money .
no . i just sit in . they don't seem to mind . they've been very con@@ geni@@ al about it .
uh .. excuse me sir , it's the air re@@ ci@@ r@@ cu@@ lating system , sir ...
stu was with me last night .
do they ?
he's drugged out of his mind ! he's completely z@@ oned out .
dead .
didn't look that way - - you know - - from a distance .
it's a amusing an@@ ec@@ do@@ te about a drug deal .
in vin@@ o ver@@ it@@ as .
your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight . and the tide rushes in .
well , not really , i - -
sure , sheriff .
have they analyzed the one that was killed ?
yes .
well , thank you , i expect she will appreciate it .
where is it ?
so the wi@@ re@@ ta@@ ps we conducted on ser@@ na and pa@@ di@@ che , the mention of israel's heart ?
my husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you . he would have approved , i am sure , of my calling on you in this way . i trust it does not inconvenience you too much .
i don't know . my fax said " have a good fright " .
what don't you know ?
that's what i said .
i realize that ...
tell me about it .
jeff . sorry . i didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago .
why do they have to die for me ?
yes , everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors ' wardrobe , food products , to the very homes they live in - -
it's alright ... it's ai@@ right . he's gone , michael ... gone .
hey , man , how's it going ?
yes , sir . they have the di@@ ph@@ ther@@ ia there , haven't they , sir ?
that's not necessarily a bad thing .
thank you , bobby .
don't they have to be ? ...
up .
well , how did it go ? . what happened ?
you always talk like this ? you're not gonna start chan@@ ting or anything are you ?
really ?
well , that's a load off .
sure , i'll give you a shot at it , but ganz is mine . you know , that big indian plays it for keeps ...
that is so romantic .
send for goebbels .
mr . crabtree was saying how george sanders killed himself , only he couldn't remember how .
that'll do .
- - posed to mean ?
sure . yeah .
don't try to be a policeman , old man .
like an agent with one client .
what are you , nuts ? you think she's coming back ?
aw , honey you know i can't do that .
i made it up . it's horseshit !
all right , let's forget about them for the time being . what about your weed man ?
give the man a hug , boy ! that's your father !
well , you wanna shoot <u> back </u> , it give you a big <u> target </u> ...
you look so happy - - how long have you been married ?
get <u> out </u> of here !
is that what they're calling him ?
you ever think about going back ?
sometimes things are simpler than you think . let me ask you a question .
he still thinks i'm going with him . i'm going to break the news to him tomorrow .
well , i hope you like it .
yeah . i ... i fell asleep . i can't believe it . i - -
this is another victory , my friends . what began with the la@@ sh shall be concluded with a care@@ ss .

white-@@ walls ?
no change . the minute you open the door , he goes into his act .
this fork is filthy .
well , he and mrs . nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit .
so far i've been told i can cooperate and get probation , maybe . or , i can stand mute and get as much as five years . does that sound right ?
i was a senator , you know .
no suicide .
any word on the location of the stro@@ des ?
oh - - right ! uh , madison 34@@ 89 .
really ?
i found it , ev@@ y ! i found it
so . i guess we just divorce our sp@@ ou@@ ses , marry each other , and have this baby , right ? simple .
emotion tricks all of us , mrs . rand . and you are a woman with a very strong conscience . that conscience has been tormenting you . the rest is coincidence . there is no such thing as a zombie . the dead do not come back to life . death is final .
i beg your pardon , brother . what did you say you were hunting ?
i'm at 8@@ 150 wonderland avenue . it's right off laurel .
should i tell you why i joined our late la@@ men@@ ted ni@@ hi@@ lists ? why i became a murderer ? because murder ... is bliss . it's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate evil - - once you've adopted its procedure .
tell it to the ones that did this to me .
agent scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building . that you wanted to go back .
i wish i could see him .
yeah . cheers , mate .
you're crazy .
i can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this ! scotty , is there any way di@@ lithium can be re-@@ crystallized ?
i couldn't tell you .
those are feds .
pool@@ side ?
i guess we shouldn't fight in here .
when did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority ? are you mad at me for giving the cabin new hair@@ cuts or are you just still mi@@ ser@@ ably p@@ in@@ ing for wi@@ ch@@ it@@ a's lightning rod ?
hey , luther told me he was carrying a wad , but i didn't figure this much .
that's what i'm afraid of . could you see me - - driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep - - wearing combat boots and a three day beard ?
that's all the windows , dad .
he sure did .
hey , ray . guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and sam's ?

oh , my goodness ...
oooo@@ o@@ wee@@ e ! ! you shoulda seen me ! like i'd been doin ' it all my life ! nobody would ever believe it .
okay . but , what ?
also , melinda , please don't tell anybody at the store that albert was here tonight , okay .
god ! it looks like the army !
hey , bless your heart for what you're trying to do . i was panicking for a moment , but i've got my senses back now . the situation is , i'm shot in the belly . and without medical attention , i'm gonna die .
help , huh ? and i don't suppose this help has anything to do with money , does it ?
did you ever hear of " the lone rider of santa fe ? "
she didn't want me to be a climber . she wanted me to be a plan@@ ner like her .
hey - i'm getting married in the morning - i already gave up drinking . one cru@@ tch at a time , doctor .

god may have given it , but claude banks spotted it and nur@@ tur@@ ed it .
don't lecture me on race relations . i don't have a mole@@ cu@@ le of prejudice . i've been in battle with every kind of man there is . i've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--@@ from a la@@ plan@@ der to a ti@@ er@@ ra del fu@@ e@@ gi@@ an . if i'd ever been to the south pole , there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me . cook !
are you familiar with that ship ? the black pearl ?
maybe later .

who ?
well , you're right . i guess it wouldn't .
right . you're quite the sir galahad today , aren't ya ' ? i heard what you did with kross .
i don't know a witness . he seemed to know something about animals - - you know - - expert testimony .
you can't - - it's too dangerous - -
that bite healed up quickly . it's been about three weeks ?
not even close .
all right ! shut up a second and i'll tell you ! jesus ! i didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked .
dewey , personal lives and pa@@ sts aside , this is about sidney . we need to know where she is .
where did they go ?
how do you know my di@@ m-@@ witted in@@ experience isn't merely a subtle form of mani@@ pu@@ lation used to lower people's expectations there@@ by en@@ han@@ cing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation ?
you sure ?
you were the only sullivan in the phone book .
tch ... how romantic . yeah . if i wasn't already committed to lydia , boy . except an@@ ne@@ 'd never go for me though . she loves you too much . and you really love her , huh ?
we've met .
i know every child is special in their own way , but tommy sounds like a punk . i thought the play was excellent . better than cats .
it was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization .
yes , she told me . do you have children , mr . creasy ?
i-@@ uh , love is , uh , is too weak a word for what ...
i will i promise .
what did you say ?
why ?
mortgage department , first national bank .
that is so u@@ no@@ ri@@ gin@@ al . you disappoint me , randy .
we can live with that .
and what does <u> that </u> mean ?
you still got that map ?

let me see it .
i want you to come in till i get the lights on .

you said entrance wound in the forehead , no exit wound .
so that ... ? ? ?
when i give an order , you'll not need it interpreted . you have an hour to make your mind up . well , are ye satisfied , mr . mitchell ?
you were there to help dr . marx deliver her baby . were you not ?

the transmission is an hour old ...
i'm sorry .
i'd go for penetration . the 4@@ 58 shooting soli@@ ds - - less ammo to carry anyway .
... life is un@@ sp@@ ea@@ k@@ ably rare . so whenever we do find another civilization , especially one that's ... struggling ... we send a message . sometimes we can offer help . sometimes we can't . but we always try . life is simply too precious not to .
i see .
johnny ! where the hell have you been ?
i'm talking about the letter , asshole .
my nephew , leonard . he worships me . let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last .
forget the store . think big .
yeah , they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of " k@@ oo@@ ls " to the world . " sealed " doesn't hurt scru@@ g@@ gs ' litigation , and since we're the only ones with the story , i believe we're sitting on an exclusive .
that's all ?
a little bad luck ?
why are they doing this ?
you know , he's got a point . we're fucking americans . we stick out like sore thumbs .
was it great ? better than great , it had to be ...
it's me or wallace , jack . wallace's third party is only going to help mcgovern . i need your support .
john believes in the basic goodness of man , and that's fine , but ga@@ ze into the pit like i have and that view seems a little so@@ por@@ i@@ fi@@ c . and not unlike television , it hardly represents the real world ...
absolutely !
a singer . her husband's an actor . i knew them well . good people . i'd like to talk to her .
what's gone ?
she's not alone ... she's ... boyd ... oh god ... he's gone nuts ... he killed lois and micheal ... it's all ...

perhaps there is some good in you after all , lex luthor .
well , all the same . if we get to mi@@ ss@@ ou@@ la , help me find a car . i'd appreciate it . then ... you can ...

fuckin ' a , first survive , yes ?
that's not a burn .
i'm listening .
marcus , you honor me , but i'm a soldier , politics scare the hell out of me .
wonderful . when your next book is published , maybe you could come into the store and do a signing . i'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up .
it'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it . the line could get tangled in something .
because you didn't love him - -
where'd you learn to fight like that ?
then i'd kiss you without turning my gar@@ ments in@@ si@@ de-@@ out and sewing bells all over .
you shouldn't ever say that about your parents , not even your dad .
what difference does it make ?
one likes to live simply .
<u> expected </u> ... offer .

i lied .
this stuff could kill ... be my guest .
no , sir ...
she's just not the girl for me .
you wouldn't because you know there are consequences . it's in those eyes of yours , though ... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work . i won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner . i only took their sins to logical conclusions .
it's very small .
i do ?
beautiful night .

you remember buzz meeks , dudley ?
you stop him ?
listen to yourself . why would i do anything like what you're describing ?
my script ?
you got it wrong . i'm the one that's on your side .
a girl has to have a bit of glamour .

got to catch me first - -
yeah , i think so .
you've got to be kidding me ! his lazy ass couldn't win the special olympics .
i don't know , i just thought it was interesting .
when you need us , you love us , when you don't , we're sh@@ un@@ ned by the rest of the department .

hey , skins - - get away with that sheet metal all right ?
well , oh ...
- - i'm trying - -
hardly .
what time is it ?
yeah . tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit .
don't go starting rumors , jim . my son's college bound with or without basketball .
claire .
not especially .
what are you listening to ?
wow , you walked out with my mother ?
stop it !
or why don't you just put a sign outside ? " no dogs or women allowed ! "
no kiddin ' , without a key , it'll take us a month to crack this thing ,
they should be . they're both good at it .
i can't believe you're still here .
deputy we@@ b@@ ber@@ 's at the party . it's only three blocks away .

my mouth is kinda dry .
i'm busy , man .
aaah ... stop picking on me ... you're as bad as the rest of them .
and as far as hiding a body goes ? i find it hard to believe even the dir@@ ti@@ est of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess . it's absolutely preposterous . now i'm not saying i don't believe you , i'm ... am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ous . there's quite alot of money behind all this .

i can't control what happens . the sheriffs are running the scene .
excuse me , but - i must formally protest this meeting . given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - i see no reason to involve the air force , the army , or mi - 6 . this is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her majesty's royal navy .
it's big , right jahn ?
you don't mean that doctor ?
oh . my condolences .

we're both of us damned , my beauty .

i'm sorry . professor tripp . maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her . it just looks ... really lonely . hanging there . in a closet . maybe i'm just a little sad .
our problems are very complex , mr . klaatu . you mustn't judge us too har@@ sh@@ ly .

but , skipper , cou@@ gar@@ 's been picked for top gun ... he's the best of the best !
they send us to za@@ mm@@ it@@ o's house . the fbi is right across the street watching the whole thing , but they don't move . a crime is going down and they don't move . why ? because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us .
i would never !

i don't know . i think he's cryin ' !
killing jake mckenna's got to amount to something . he wasn't much of a man , but that don't give you the right to murder him . and don't tell me you didn't , ' cause i know you did . i was there . like i said ; i been watching you .

you can't come here .
that's dis@@ gu@@ stin ' . those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public . is this bi@@ lo@@ x@@ i yet ?
that's not why i'm here ... ... though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about spencer ...
i said , ` i'm dead ' . he killed me .

that's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken . the fact that you made the choice to pursue this life - style ... much to the cha@@ gr@@ in of your mother ... who is so clearly ashamed of you . imagine her shame when we cart you off to prison because you won't just tell the truth about what really happened . <b> ext . nevada desert - - day for night [ mescaline trip ]

well , like mama told me , aunt roo@@ tie , dell's mama ? she found cockroaches in dell's underwear .
when does frederick ever come with her ?
come on , alvy , they're only baby ones , for god's sake .
i don't want to nail you . i just want to know who put you up to it . i'll give you a few days to think it over . call me . i can help . who knows ? maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years .

ryan's novel .
there goes a thousand dollars .
nothing . i just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you . you didn't say goodbye .
what do you mean ?
all right . maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this .
i need the latest p@@ drs on st . petersburg .
admiral , this is spock .
that's a fact . what you do , boy ?
the sort of questions you should be asking yourself .
i think i might've said i was in love with you .
uh ... nell v@@ ance ...
drop it .
yeah , i guess he still lives with her . seemed like a sweet lady - - got diabetes or something - - so i went out on a limb and got him transferred down to pro@@ vi@@ dence .
it's that girl from the boardwalk . is she one of them ?
you don't know ? she left thirty minutes ago .
do you know ... i think those are the first words i have heard from you my entire time here .
yes yes ... any moment ... you're always so impatient ...
i can't believe you made it !
maybe we should make the time . especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events .
yes . perhaps he would at that .
you'd do a good job .
anytime , sport .
she was just asking about you - whether it was nice to work for you or not .
i'm not the one who put this scar here .
your majesty
yes , that sociopath . he's given himself over to the evil of ly@@ can@@ thro@@ p@@ y . to him , adam is just a threat to the terror he holds over others . to us , it's salvation .
that's not him ... jesus , stop freaking me out .
but she'll have no one to look after her !
rose , sit down in that chair and be quiet ! we're trying to help you , you silly creature , sit in that chair !
well , i think that's perfectly understandable .
the crow is a permanent resident throughout its range . in fact , during our christmas count , we recorded ...
i'm not gonna need it . i won't even wear it . it's a precaution . don't worry about me .
it's no problem , i had a mother once myself .
true .
going to try . didn't say i could .
i'm off for a pi@@ sh . when i come back , that money's still here , ok ?

what ? no kiss ? not even for old times sake ?
oh . oh , yeah . no . this is a different one .
first question got to be " where . "
shutup ! - - after all ! you haven't talked to me for a week and now i'm going to say my piece . i've got a pre@@ di@@ ction for you , norville barnes : i predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and slo@@ th and everything bad , you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you . you're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you ... if you ...
i think they're getting worse .
peter ...
an old sto@@ mping ground - - is this the " attack " portion of the interview , i figured this was coming sooner or later - - is " the girl " coming in for the kill ?
mr . saavik , all stop .
why ? why he have to ask ? can't nobody offer ? what's going on ? since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog ? !
yeah well , it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed , and needs an exorcist .
yeah .
hold it a minute .
when is it finally over ? i want it to be over before my baby is born .
you have no right , no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game .
well , mrs . hillyer , the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive . but not many people walk away from double pneumonia , madam , not many .
hmm ? i dunno . cha@@ fing from the backpack , something .
i have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point . i've tried to p@@ are down my collection to the essential ...
look , it isn't proof , okay ? someone may have put the chemical in the outlet , but we found it as a va@@ por in co@@ s@@ gro@@ v@@ e's clothes .
you can't put her out of your mind , is that it ?
yes , sir .
suck my ass .
the weird thing is i've had an odd , morbid fa@@ sc@@ in@@ ation with wolves ever since .
don't worry , janet . bra@@ d@@ 'll probably get just what he needs .
oh , lord ...
yeah , i talked to your mom . i think i woke her up . i hope i didn't get you in trouble .

i feel so <u> close </u> to you ...
well - - professor barnhardt , i guess . he's the greatest scientist in the world .
eli . why can't you remember their names ?
i don't know .
never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday .
mad dog co@@ ll's in town on a job .
depends , who pays ?
why do they tell little kids that ?
and how do you suggest i do that ?
that's for sure .
you called , doctor ?
why ? so you can kill me too ? tex is dead , i've seen him ! he said dyle did it !
what you just did for laszlo , and that fairy tale that you invented to send ilsa away with him . i know a little about women , my friend . she went , but she knew you were lying .
that was an awful thing to say to me .
no . i mean work work .
she was on her way home from a meeting of the african violet society , and they got her .
nine o ' clock . oh , i'm late ! maybe i'll see you later .
across both tracks ! !
to the left twice then five no ... sorry ... i think it's fifteen ... it's been a while ...
bet they don't dust crops in japan .
i beg your pardon ?
you're missing most of your life , jim , and you don't even know it . the kids are missing out too . it's not just you making the sacrifice here , honey .
maybe i should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent , huh - marry some poor dope like - - oh , like carlos domin@@ gu@@ e@@ z - - and get fat and -
i surprise you ? now that's news .
she's not the world's greatest flyer , let me tell you . when she was eight years old , she ...
anything to spare ?
yes . well , i'm coming over to your house to get some things .
oh-oh . holly ... and his wife's , uh , in and out of institutions . she's schizophrenic .
but it's impossible .
no . josie , this is real .
you mean the designs for the nanobot ? you think after this i'm going to give them to him ?
bo@@ gu@@ tu@@ de . blow it off .
i'm travelling too .
a ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard , adrift ? and nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it ?
from her point of view or mine ?
that's what we call in the trade , audition free-@@ for - alls and most of it sucks . bit i don't think that's her .
phones went down a few minutes ago .
what ?
not yet .
not at all , honey .
shit , thank god . you look like a creep .
keep the change .
hi . up ahead my boss is in that black limo . we're not sure which hotel we're at , so could you just follow them ?
not just ju@@ ani@@ to . you'll have it good too , es@@ per@@ an@@ za . we're going to win this strike .
we're from different worlds .
even those delicate veins , the te@@ x@@ ture of this flesh - - i have never seen anything more exquisite .
i don't understand . aren't you frightened ?
the cops have it locked in and i got my people there visiting pop all the time . what about the hit list .
now that's more of what we're looking for .
they had them on the big one ...
this is colonel richards .
i have a new client .
please don't tell me it's how you play the game .
who the hell opened my files ! you've been looking through my private files , haven't you , you weasel ?
so she knew about his heart ?
where are you right now ?
rot in hell , melvin .
i like you , jerry . a lot .
okay , good reason . then what ?
yep .
why ?
you're in no condition to go anywhere - - except back to bed .
you want me to make you a sling ? it's no problem ...
listen , sucker , yuh ever been broke ?
you mean , like to throw ' em off ?
i can't take this anymore .
just you wait until i'm foreign secretary . can't you just see me , freshie , with all those other shrewd , little foreign secretaries ? you see , the trick is to see who can out-@@ talk the other . everybody wants something for nothing , and if you can't get it with smooth talk , you send an army in . i'm going to fool them , freshie . i'm not going to have an army . i'm going to dis@@ band mine . i'm going to sink my ba@@ tt@@ le@@ ships - i'm going to destroy every piece of war@@ craft . then when the enemy approaches we'll say , " come in , gentlemen - what can we do for you ? " so then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think . and what will they think , freshie ? they'll think to themselves - " something's wrong here . we've been du@@ ped . this is not according to form . these people seem to be quite friendly , and why should we shoot them ? " then they'll lay down their arms . you see how simple the whole thing is ? centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants and i'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum .
what does it mean ? i ... i mean we , you have other tactics ...
good morning ... we need a name for him , don't we ?
you've never built in africa .
you kept it ?
yes ...
all right . then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being .
yes , lord .
i guess the news youd sent me after friedman didnt go down too well , eh ?
where do you want to go ?
we're upstairs , george . now come on . behave yourself , and for christ's sake , do me a favor . don't let me drink too much .
maybe i like to find out about a man first . maybe i like to know what he's made of .
the word is no . i am therefore going anyway .
i wrote a check for a thousand dollars . you guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen ?
it was ' 72 . i figured we had enough problems without monitoring a berkeley kid's class schedule . so i sold my story to <u> ramparts </u> and split .
oh come on , why would i lie ?
i can give you five . you didn't do very much to these .
don't call me that , please .
yeah . hurry up though .
you don't seem bothered .

let's go niggers .

and he means that strictly in a non - pri@@ son@@ -@@ movie type of way .
just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet , and we'll get along fine .
no .
going to the coast was alan's idea . if he's alive , thats where he's headed .
sssh . that's what i'm taking care of . they need a letter of permission .
and you must be steed . please don't get up .
give me back that hot dog . i'll eat it myself .
you won't do that .
miss kubelik , i don't think you ought to call anybody - - not till that chewing gum is out of your head .
well , yes , it's just a manner of speech from your post corrective advisor to you that you watch out , little alex . he puts his arm round alex's shoulder .
it's okay , stanley . it's alright .
no .
do i look that needy ?
what , jack ? that tomorrow night beneath the full moon i'll sp@@ r@@ out hair and fangs and eat people ? bullshit !
nobody can help me . you , least of all .

it was you and it turned my teeth black for a month .
then what ?
uh , you first .
what i've heard so far , it's all a lot of talk . i wasn't so sure what to make of it at first , cause , like i said , the irish and the russians are an unlikely mix .
never saw him , was your basic hit and run .
a novel , mr . martins ?
alright , i believe you . stop crying . your se@@ cre@@ t's safe with me .
no , it's no good@@ ---@@ you can't practice - - - you only get one go . a thing like that . no . sure you don't want a sip of this ? it's delicious , i think .

who's " we " ?
y'know what , guys ? i woke up this morning , i got a really lucky feeling going on . i mean it , i'm feeling that good . i wouldn't be surprised if i walk in there , pull a handle and hit jackpot . hell , we wouldn't even have to - -
doing well . this is ?
exactly . i would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things . or could mean lots of things .
started every game my senior year . not all-american or anything , but not bad . anyway , the real star was my best friend , the quarterback . got taken in the first round .
did you ever go out with someone and just ... lie ... question after question , maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever , or smarter or cooler and you just - - not really lie , but maybe you just don't say everything - -
... and me . no , that's be me and me . is that what i said ?
oh , my god - - it's miles davis . this is " king of blue " ! this is the original recording . hard to find in good condition . where did you find this ?
- he's got them on him .
and a fact is a fact .
his remarks were directed at the quality of the writing , not its subject .
who's shari ?
north . it's north
of course you don't know .
welcome home eleanor . welcome home ? i've never been here . who did this ?
roger .

so when was he here ?
can i speak to you in confidence ?
i thought i was . i was confused .
oh , i'm very sorry father . hi .
what have you been up to ?
you did last night .
you don't even know me . the fact of the matter is there is some one i love . she's smarter , prettier ... you don't even compare to her . the only reason i am here is because she wants us to be exclusive .
but what we need is national coverage . it's difficult with this fal@@ k@@ lands madness going on . do you think you might be able to do something when you get back ?
daddy , why can't i ... ?
what happened ... ?
perfect .
we've done studies . we're confident we would turn them back eventually ... after they'd gotten as far as chicago .
i'll be all right , chauncey you go ahead with mrs . aubrey ...
i wasn't kidding . i'd like to take you out .
two guys .
wave from the door ... go down the stairs ... get into the limo ...
take the radio , stay down here in the lobby , watch the elevator .
what the fuck am i afraid of ? !
no . this must be a friendship that only we shall have ... you and i ... amy and her friend .
hey , ever think about reti@@ rin ' ?
how did you come to know their names ?
you might hold this for me .

mattie . what about this ?
no plans for the weekend , linda ?

i'm tired .
i have my own warrant . stop a minute , please .
c'mon , chief , if it's sensitive , tell me .. i'm not taking notes ..
that's the kind of a kid brother you'd have !

that was an ark , man . that was a torah . they fucked around with it , and the torah melted their faces .
the same place . one o'clock . i have to go now . see you tomorrow . remember , i need you .

hey , if everybody's gonna kill each other , could you do it in another room ? i'm trying to get something accomplished here .
sounds right ... i'll check it out .
i feel fine .

hold it right there .
if you don't sleep , you don't dream . if you don't dream , you don't have nightmares .
okay , jerry . you're ta@@ s@@ king us to perform this mission , but you , you won't , uh , you won't - aw , fuck it , let's take a look at that ciera .
you've lost everything ?
on behalf of the tea@@ m@@ sters ' pension fund , it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
i couldn't let him interfere with my project .
i don't know , honey .
you bet i do , sir .
more soldiers ?
yes .
up to you . i'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that .
whatever it is you're upset about .
you sc@@ or@@ pi@@ os can never take a joke .
never heard of it , any huntin ' ?
that would be inconceivable .
no . you know too many sick ladies .
wondering what ?
he says he knows his face . he sees it when he closes his eyes .
this isn't a home , it's the crossroads of the world !
you tell the boy who knocked you up ?
i killed you .
you look all right now .
i tried your atm pin . i gotta kill an hour . let's grab a beer .
where's the third one , travers ?
by 7@@ :@@ 46 , when the tide turns around , we'll be twenty miles out . more , with this wind .
... let me ... are you listening to me ... ?
i can't sit on this balcony forever . i'm beginning to feel like a po@@ tted plant .
val ! val !
the young girl is sla@@ shed again .
no , i need some serious household advice .
how ya feelin ' , artie ? i heard you wasn't doin ' too well recent .
just for the symmetry of the thing ... ?
all right , amy . button your sweater , darling . it's turning cold .
i'm fine . little nervous ... little disappointed that i didn't finish this myself .
please , just a minute .
hey - - doug st@@ all@@ worth ? it's his loss .
ann ?
what's up with that ?
i ... <i> love ... </i> pat benatar .
where's he gone ?
hi , annie , laurie ...
i remember ..
what happened to you , then ?
... sales promotion , " you lose , then we fire your ... " no . it's medieval ... it's wrong . " or we're going to fire your ass . " it's wrong .
quite simple . yes . good .
i'm sorry .
crabs ?
i swear to god , jos . when is the last time you went on a real live date ?
i decided to make a female figure after all ! i want you to pose for it .
the thing ! he was lying there in the street , moaning . but he pointed at it ... 22
i don't know . wherever you want .
that's five hundred dollars .
we're not upset with you , dave . we think you did a terrific job . don't we ?
he look familiar ?
i lay awake nights in a cold sweat , i want this party to be like some - thing mom would have made for you , i want it to be perfect - -
the old ones were much spo@@ o@@ ki@@ er . they had castles , full mo@@ ons ...
why not act the role of her@@ o@@ ines instead ? queen esther from the bible , or st . joan ?
look , it's dr . tom . hey , dr . tom !
' course how could you miss , right ? twenty , maybe thirty feet . i mean , if i'@@ d'@@ a been where you guys were - -
a lunch@@ box ? !
i wouldn't bet on that .
- - you've got to listen to me . do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here ? nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp . isn't that true , louis ?
see you later , sh@@ or@@ ti@@ e--@@ i'm off to the pool .
damn right !
what sins have you to confess ?
listen , man . i got rolled half an hour ago for everything i had .
damn . gonna be another hot one today . sometimes i don't even want to get out of bed . course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither . then of course the clouds come in ...
i wish i could .
date ?
yes .
absolutely .
nobody would believe us . we'd still get in trouble . we'd still have our lives ruined . and you know what else ?
you said the worm was un@@ trea@@ c@@ ea@@ ble !
where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms .
god knows , but it was a bad idea !
i wasn't sleeping . you ok ?
you know it , lilly .
uncommon , too .
i've gotta study .
uh ... none just now , but ...
is that bug juice , or are you just glad to see me ?
we've just finished , pauly . hey george , write us your john henry on this picture .
what about them ?
and the good news is you won't charge me .
save me the grief . step out of the car , sir , and open the trunk .
anyone skim the pool ? it needs it .
yes , i believe that's right . now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure , the victim becomes infectious . highly infectious .
i don't mind .
- - well aren't you - -
did you talk to graff ?
you never got back to me . ... i called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal ? ... kind of a professional welcome .
... art sank , sun set , ark sank again ...
you're going to kill me .
you've been doing your homework . look , they can't impound it if they don't know about it .
oh , space ! - - you said the right thing .
i thought she wasn't your girlfriend , dude .
don't get sidetracked ! how does he get back to the states ? that's the point . does he have any problems ?
yeah , i think i'm bleeding .
what , you growing gills all of a sudden ? you got it on , keep it on .
bird ! ask me the name of my sa@@ il@@ boat - -
why ? why do you have to go ?
well , fine . thanks very much , anyway , and i hope you don't mind me asking ?
right . see ? you're ready for the quiz .
yes .
you're quite serious about this , aren't you , buckaroo . we know each other pretty well , i think .
that's thinking . now , he's got the leads , he goes in business for himself . he's ... that's what i ... that's thinking ! " who ? who's got a steady job , a couple bucks nobody's touched , who ? "
i don't know . he made me see the stars ...
a model , only as big as this .
hell , i could tell you some stories
moreover ...
he more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something . that's what usually happens .
okay .
well , we can't force her . it's her decision .
just tell me where it hurts , baby .
after all , that's how you catch fish , isn't it ?
next .
they stole the ...
right . like last night's doo@@ zie .
the same as jane mckenna .
you were the admitting nurse at st . catherine laboure hospital on may twelfth , nineteen seventy-six , the night deborah ann kaye was admitted ...
and so explain it away ? but there is a way to explain it , you see . if i'm mad ? that would explain it , wouldn't it ?
right .
i'm here .
those are all from the fair last year . abbott and me were judges at the pet show .
man this is heavy !
every class has its surprises , py@@ ro . this one'll be no different .
on what ?
don't call her mother all the time . it makes her sound tragic and un@@ forgiving . what happened to mom ?
it is a courier , captain . grade one priority . non-@@ be@@ lli@@ ger@@ ency confirmed .
julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet .
i know that .
listen . you think you're responsible for everything that happens . don't fla@@ ge@@ lla@@ te yourself - and don't flatter yourself , either . you're not the center of the universe . you're just ... peter .
but it's ...
or your fucking wife , jerry .
in this heat ? they're up now .
i guess not .
that's very interesting .
third measure , second beat starting on e . fla@@ m-@@ mis a-@@ cri@@ -@@ bus ad@@ -@@ di@@ c-@@ tis . and fourth measure , fourth beat - d . ma-@@ le-@@ di@@ c-@@ tis , fla@@ m-@@ mis a-@@ cri@@ -@@ bus ad - di@@ c-@@ tis . do you have that ?
i bought him a watch too .
maybe the thief thought you had something valuable . you are in the business , that's what ro@@ ki says .
you're comfortable . this is a life of convenience for you , and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic micro@@ co@@ sm you've fashioned for yourself .
four years .
even pigeons aren't peaceful .
put the plates down . it's over .
i feel sick .
she would never . never . even think of that .
i guess it's possible .
i know what i saw and it wasn't a fucking " optical effect ! "
very good .
why not ? poly@@ ga@@ m@@ y's legal in utah .
he did ?
no ! this is my private property . according to california law we have a constitutional right to bear arms .
it's not going to be lonely , judy . not for you and not for me .
we stood here once before .
why do people think yellow is gender - neutral ? i don't know one man with a yellow bedroom .
this i know , benny .
i think i know where a cb is .
we'll see ...
i'm sorry .
well , i'm just asking . you sound a little
- - something horrible ... i don't understand - -
i called because i just want ... i need to talk .
tonight . let's get together .
no . i can't .
yes .
hey , i thought you weren't a buffet person .

i know but let's hear it anyway .
linda - -
there should be a new word for happiness . being here with miss channing has been - i just can't say , she's been so wonderful , done so much for me -
you are such a raving pussy sometimes .
don't threaten me , miles . i did nothing illegal .
sure .
yeah .
at-@@ at-@@ at-@@ at-@@ at .
eee@@ eu@@ uu@@ ww , gross .

thank christ ! we lost you ! listen , there's been a new development - -
now you're talking !
does that mean suck my dick ?
maybe .
yeah ?
her fucking body fell out !
really ?
probably .
ha ... no , mr lombard . his monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us . he knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate .
unfortunate , but i think we can work around it .
it is a favor , isn't it ?
i got lucky .
on the in@@ fill . the guy from l . a . ' s just gone down there ..
tell me . what do the police say ?
why did you take jamie ?
you're a bit deaf , aren't you ? i said what time do you go to bed .
take something off .
so , we got you on an earlier flight , but i really think you should think about staying for that talk show .
well , i could go for a tall glass of polar bear milk right now .
what did darryl say ?
well , you look it . you win ?
some@@ wheres . i don't know yet .
i've all ready gone six hundred miles ... i can't do it again .
damn it , val ! not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this !
he started it .
well , i'll be seeing you in a couple of days , won't i ?
sorry ?
hey , where's claude ? i don't see claude !
in the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff . when they're having sex .
lead mine .
you're already there ...
tomorrow morning .
all the time . it's always " loma vista " this , " loma vista " that .
well , one thing immediately comes to mind , if what you are saying is true - - he would merely withdraw his army from moscow and return to poland for the winter .
if thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress , thy strength shall be di@@ mini@@ shed .
against thy king , thou vile fool ! hast thou anything to say ?
don't you think he trusts us together ?
we have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world . most of europe , the middle east and asia are battle ready .
and that i can drive a truck !
just in time for what ?
you don't even know me . the fact of the matter is there is some one i love . she's smarter , prettier ... you don't even compare to her . the only reason i am here is because she wants us to be exclusive .
relax ... it was fifteen years ago . i don't do it now .
he is ?
yes .
- - you're not making sense ! ! what " scarecrow " ?
i'm ready .
this is everything ? is there .
i saw you play , man . you were good . like a fucking freight train i remember saying . so what happened , injuries or what ?
a teacher ! dong ! ! ! you know i admire brains . take my brother charley . he's very brain@@ y . very .
no , junior , you shouldn't touch her .
yeah . let's keep it - -
yes . it's a very good show .
we all do . but now i understand you're eager to get back to work - - and not the kind of work that we're all expecting .
bab@@ a mama !
yeah .
will he understand spanish ?
a book !
goddammit , you sly son-of-a-bitch ! does anybody else know ?

jake . i thought you would be at work , dear .
nothing we can do , man .
... you can leave whenever you want . i don't refrain you .
the documents are forged .
winter . two straight months of night - - we may never get out of bed . which would suit me fine .
bullshit ! you get your boy off that roof or i swear to god i'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of .
get the hell off of me !
you gotta get another tour . we're gettin ' too old for this .
i'm a wolf ?
then why is reed dragging his feet ? maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass ... it's ironic , isn't it ? you're finally the perfect woman for him ... because you're his science project .
of course . i don't want to scare you off . not before i'm finished with you .
and she didn't ?
it was hard to have him killed .
good . this is the turn of luck i have been waiting for .
listen , no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy , but when the time comes , you have to do it and you <u> hope </u> the outcome will be good for both of you . you come out of solitary and you re@@ join the human race , as difficult as that sometimes can be .
it's not bad , it's ok .
hi princess .
it was beautiful . and getting better all the time .
dea ex mach@@ ina ...
hey , ang ' ...
what are you doing ? you were supposed to turn back there !
where are you staying ?

tell me more about yourself .
you got to tell em that you saw the accident . don't you ?
yes .
not in front of the kid .
tonight ?
what about you , i hear you guys are handling the fair@@ child foods merger and it may not be going through . any surprises i haven't read about in the wall street journal ?
did you play recently ?
most of what i find in here is lacking a co@@ her@@ ent picture of an organization with an att@@ ri@@ bu@@ table motive . i realize you're very lucky to be alive agent scully . the ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you - - though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the justice department . until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation .
what are you going to do ? shoot me ?
dieter asked where i was . he expected me here . maybe someone was assigned to bring me here .
you made a terrible mistake , ke@@ e@@ gan . you didn't do what i said .
magic johnson .
what ?
what makes you say that ?
it's a coincidence .
you all right now ?
our semi-@@ con@@ du@@ ct@@ ors are down !
karla ! you promised .
cynthia ! sure .
hey freddy , what's goin ' on boy . i seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin ' that big-@@ ass bass .
i may be a shu@@ t-@@ in , but i do not lack for news . i'm sorry you had to go through all that .
who's the girl ?
we must be right over the colony . let's get some air support , eh ?
if he were only that . the man's evil himself . some day you'll know him as macfarlane knows him - - for macfarlane he was to knox as you are to him . that brought him close to gray , he ro@@ i@@ ster@@ ed with him and drank with him . aye , and gray even brought him to my door and my love . there is all that between them and more - - burke and hare and knox - -
what kinds of questions ?
thank you .
breakfast brunch - - ?
when do i get to see brad ?
they don't have a murder weapon ?
it could be a cover , i suppose .
you have .
what is that a threat ? are you fuckin ' threatening me , marcel ?
hey - - comrade ! over here ! this is harry shapiro - - the volga boatman of barrack four !
bullshit . they ain't been in the office yet . give ' em some stiff . we have a deal or not ? eh ? two sits . the des pla@@ ines . both of ' em , six and ten , you can do it ... six and ten ... eight and eleven , i don't give a shit , you set ' em up ? alright ? the two sits in des pla@@ ines .
... they won't let you go ...
it's a com@@ for@@ tin ' idea .
the hell you will . you know too much about me as it is ... now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on be@@ ta@@ zed .
oh , my god .
heather chandler , kurt kelly , and rupert " ram " sweeney all had good looks and popularity , but there's one thing they didn't have : values , ambition , and hope .
she thinks you're with simone .
bobby ? are you all right ?
it's obviously an ab@@ or@@ ti@@ ci@@ de .
really ? ...
oh , he ain't nobody .
oh no , sir . i putter with me hands .
yeah . i'm sure .
i do .
cross my heart .
watch your language , young fellow , this is a public market . now , if you want dapper dan i can order it for you , have it in a couple of weeks .
look - - i'll be in there later today . i'll come by and tell you all about it .
you're anthony ?
mixed emotions , buddy : like larry wi@@ l@@ d@@ man going off a cliff in my new ma@@ ser@@ at@@ i . men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines , fuel could go up , unions are killers ...
real char@@ mer .
you don't like punk ro@@ ckers ?
what do you want to do , leave the station with her ?
you know , my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist ... living in a gar@@ re@@ t , poor but free !
that seems to be what it has planned - - to have the creator physically present here .
okay .
okay . okay . here's what you do .
you afraid of these ... ?
i'm sure it won't be difficult to find you .
hold it a minute .
they're part of the team . one of them's the guy i told you about .
i guess i don't know what the hell i'm talking about .
yeah . me and my boy here are gonna be in new york overnight . i want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight . i'm talkin ' a california style , tu@@ pa@@ c , gangster pool party back at the hotel . and make that drink a double .
but one day i'll catch you ... like i caught her ...
i don't need proof . i know it . send it out .
him dying like that .
ok ok ... we're just gonna head inside here ...
yes .
why yes .
they didn't teach it at memorial hospital . i had my suspicions , though , about the direct@@ ress of training .
i'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about . take care .
sal ? sal , it's me , nick .
i mean i could see myself in movies robert de ni@@ ro had been in . or i could maybe do an al pa@@ cino movie , play a hard-on . but i couldn't see myself in ones , like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby . they don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -
buckaroo , i've done an advanced spe@@ ct@@ ro@@ graph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the jet car drive shaft .
nerves .
joe , don't do this - -
what did you say to them ... ?
that's a wolf's head .
what's wrong ?
hey . way to gut it out .
not even a little bit ?
roger . one-@@ three-@@ eight .
i'd be honored .
what about us ? are we to wait forever ? is our reward to be blown to bits on this for@@ sa@@ ken system , while your fleet moun@@ ts some suicidal attack on that death star ? part of my reward is that i be around to spend it .
yesterday that might've meant something . pull me off . you'd be doing me a big favor .
uh , with all due respect , sir , dr . long told me to prep the field for detonation at ...
it looked like a fuckin ' gun !
what is that a threat ? are you fuckin ' threatening me , marcel ?
apologize to elizabeth for me .
the check wasn't cashed ?
put - him - down ! his - his heart ...
i told them what you said - - about this man being carson dyle's brother . i asked them what they knew about it and they told me - - you're not gonna like this , mrs . lampert - - they told me carson dyle has no brother .
fine , dixie . fine .
he meant what you were saying on the tour : that if things keep on the way they're going , humpbacks will disappear forever .
i like that .
hell no , baby ... i would@@ n'@@ ta done that without tellin ' you .
oh my god . and they got a photo of you dressed like that ?
yes , sir .
what about what ?
no , this is just the second unit . we'll do the main footage later .
look here .. there's a cross up there , so i guess this here's a church or used to be . seems to me like you ought to show it some respect , you follow me ?
no big thing , we'll see who's out there , maybe picnic .
... and let me guess . this robber - - he gets your money .
a great town , that vegas . i bet you had good luck there . you're the type .
dr scott i'm sorry about your nephew .
nah , just covered with bat@@ shit !
i never said i wasn't upset . of course i'm upset . i miss her terribly . but i know what i saw and what i heard ... and it wasn't some " symptom " of something ...
where can i find him ?
i will miss you .
i wouldn't know .
get a grip . reed . we didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch . just close the shields ...
busy
really biff ? the ke@@ en@@ est ?
oh , good - - well , i hope you'll have more to tell me next time .
s'@@ all very well , but when the fit hits the shan , somebody's going to have to stay after school , and who do you ' spose that might be .

i dunno . you know . i used to really love that alice . do you know that ?

you are something we do not have in russia .
yeah , okay , right . forget it . what's to eat ?

where is your head , jerome ? you're acting like a guilty man . they won't marry the eyelash to you . they won't believe that one of their elite na@@ vi@@ ga@@ tors could have suckered them for the last five years .
uh-huh . still practice a lot of medicine ?
you better go .
that's it , man . that's the whole story .

... i didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement . we don't know who's straight up , who's not ...

i asked my doctor . he said only another emotional shock could do it , and probably wouldn't . and you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out .
would you please stop calling me that ?
of course , we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits .

i see . clearly , such interest on their part is of great political significance .
i <u> remember </u> what day you wore that jacket . it was <u> monday </u> . the day you were all day in <u> meetings </u> again ? and had to send out for <u> sandwiches </u> ?

this is great . and it's yours ? you like own it ?
i asked you a question . do you love her ?
however , with injuries such as this , i have run into minor hemorrhaging , which really isn't too serious at the time , but can cause secondary problems if not looked after .
you should . because when you're done , a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion , my friend . and that's the power you have .
i don't know about totally .
made you say it !
i'm seriously in love with you - - isn't that enough ?
please ? what friends ?

we have to try the blo@@ ck@@ ad@@ es . it probably won't work . it may just be de@@ laying the inevitable . but we can't just go to war without trying not to .
i think so ... when i was walking down the aisle ? i was walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who i really was . and it was only half the other person's fault , because i had done everything to convince him that i was exactly what he wanted . so it was good that i didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie , but you - - you knew the real me .
because it's there .
afraid of lions .
what ?
you should have been a marriage counselor . but i'll show you what's wrong with your theory .

calm down , dave , what ?
sometimes , yeah ... pulling in two different directions at once . it makes tiny little tears in our fabric .
mom . don't cry . i can change this .
but he'd have to . if he left he'd be admitting his guilt - - and the others would know what happened . whoever it is has to wait here , pretending to look for the money , waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home . that's when he'll be safe and not a minute before .
you look upset .
oh ?
arnie , do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse , because i don't think there is .
are you tired ?
this is to make sure you stay cured . georgie hits alex in the stomach with his blackjack . then , they push his head under the water and me@@ tho@@ di@@ cally start to beat him with their black@@ jacks . after a full minute of this , they drag him out , hal@@ t-@@ drowned ,

i know that . but the buses don't go there .
where the hell did you learn how to deal ?
and mom says anger never , never <u> solves </u> anything . it makes every - thing <u> worse </u> .

worried about me ! well , you just stop it !
people have to tell me these things . i've been frozen for thirty years , throw me a bone here . ok , no problem . here's my second plan . back in the sixties i had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a " laser . " using this laser , we punch a hole in the protective layer around the earth , which we scientists call the " ozone layer . " slowly but surely , ul@@ tra@@ violet ra@@ ys would pour in , in@@ crea@@ sing the risk of skin cancer . that is , unless the world pays us a hefty ransom .
i'll find something else . see you in court some day .
sheila ...
don't get smart with me , son .
probably an asteroid field ...
hmm . not bad .
i notice dr . crusher laughing along with the rest of you . as most of you know , the doctor will also soon be leaving the enterprise , to assume command of starfleet medical . again , i'm forced to ask , beverly , have you considered what you're doing to little ole me ? ! i'll probably get some old ba@@ tt@@ le-@@ axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if i dont show up for my physical on time !
what money ?
trust you and harry lee . remember that damned over@@ land you two thought up in ' 62 to hit fort louis ?
they already know it's you .
could it have been this ?
could you get here without any trouble ?
yes .
got it .
i heard what happened . it looks like somebody murdered him .
where ben ?
what ?
just a year . i dropped out to join the marines .
i've seen you . from the window .
no primer .
yeah , i guess so . anyway , there's hardly anybody to play with around here .
maybe because you're looking her in the face .
well , i'd rather not say .
... sometimes they do .
it was a mistake , i never wanted to hurt you , but it had to end sooner or later and now , well now i love someone else .
calm down , benjamin .
oh yeah , murder museum ... sounds fun .
only myself and two other girls . one is a cello player in the opera and the other a stre@@ e@@ t-@@ car conductor .
how long will these take ?
mr . bialystock . no . wait . please . you're holding me too tight . i'm an honest man . you don't understand .
thank you .
no . i don't work here .
please , could i please come in and talk to you for a minute ? maybe you could take a better look at the picture ... might stir up something .
well , he knocked at the door . you see , i was expecting two@@ --@@ uh--@@ two business associates .
about what ?
he lives here in washington , doesn't he ?
how ?
well , it's not a short one .
right . except ... time has a way of - -
i told you . filet and salmon .
but - -
this car will take me to las vegas . i cannot go back .
why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up .
are you taking janet to the reunion tonight ?
they seemed alright . bring a little life to that old building .
the ideas you get in your head .
you think he misses me at all ?
you can't mean that .
have you no feelings , woman ?
lots more where he came from .
is that the usual way priests go on vacation ?
long@@ stre@@ e@@ t's interested in the har@@ ris@@ burg deal .
... but i love listening to you , so that's okay ...
no ...
but ca@@ tho@@ li@@ ci@@ sm ? why not your own people ?
that ain't the worst part . her little sister , baby d . she's the one that gets real physical . but i got a restraining order on her , too .
the big house .
for the best . exactly . i wouldn't want things to end on a dow@@ ner .
say it again .
all right , all right .. i shouldn't ' ve asked you .
i'm not leaving without you .
in here . with us .
what if i've figured a way ?
nah , that's okay . my brother has to look up old people's asses all day long . let's give him a break .
charlie ! i've got no one else here ! you're the only person i know in los angeles ...
you don't have to keep walking with me . i'm okay from here .
i don't remember any arbor day cards from mr . rock ' n ' roll detective .
of what ? they're both crooks .
i wonder how your boys in washington are going to take this one .
why else would she have flown in from newport ? it's not like she'd fed ex a six carat diamond .
spock ! my only concern is getting the ship back . when that's done and sybok is in here then you can debate sha ka ree until you're green in the face . until then , you're either with me or you're not .
let's get out of here .
so let me see it . where is it ?
what is it , harry ?
i could have given you the world .
i don't know .
6@@ 5@@ 7-@@ 20@@ 36

the death star will be completed on schedule .
the metro .
everything is a-okay , but i've gotta get that sandwich !
in the future , will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her ?
who might these friends be ?
are you insinuating that this is not an honest report ?
when it is time .
your mind kept wandering . that bothered me .
yeah . she says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood . ' bye , dad .
you fancy him .
do what you want , it's a free country .
they re not my attack dogs .
perk , remember ?
that's not a bad place to start .
i didn't say anything .
they can bill me . i got a tab running . what's second ?
i'll tell you why . because when i was little , i had a fat cousin , cousin luke . and he used to make fun of the handicapped . and one day he had a bad sto@@ ma@@ cha@@ che . so he drank a bottle of pe@@ p@@ to and his ass blew off .
but laura ... that's me . that's all there is to me . there isn't anything else . if you've lost interest in that , you've lost interest in everything .
ha ! where's that ?
i seen the bodies before they sealed ' em up . them fellas si@@ zz@@ led up good . looked like some shit from the x - files . damn , that shit's nasty .
because i like you .
ask me what i want to change about this moment .
" you'll be burned out / or smoked out / an ' come back to me , i know ... "

i don't . katrina smells like soup . her whole house smells of soup .
so@@ ggy bottom boys - i don't precisely recollect , uh -
no , i mean your past . about why you were in here . i'll take you first thing in the mornin ' . you have anyplace you can stay tonight at all ? i just can't let you stay here . it's the rules . if something happened well , i'd be liable .

i can't be late . i don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet . i don't know if my words went to the ship . if i'm not there , the captain will think i'm dead and go .
because i'm tired of not understanding things . cops , mafia , and but@@ lers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something , which it turns out i really didn't st@@ ea@@ l@@ --it's fucked up .
hello wade .

listen , anything's , better than mystery meat .
it was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water . most homo sa@@ pi@@ ens didn't make it ... danakil man ... <u> ada@@ p@@ ted </u> .
double-@@ ex@@ po@@ sur@@ es ? but they're not - - i was in - -

annoying customer .
the rest meant nothing to me .
what a great sur@@ p@@ ri ...
but they fucking didn't do anything wrong !
do something for me .
who doesn't have such thoughts ? we'd better get going .
ohhhh ... you don't mean that .
nick ?
but - - why ?
still drawing a blank .
it's not important . the important thing is i'm here to find something and i think you can he@@ 1@@ p me .
excuse me , sir . i just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday .
granted . where are you going ?
you do .
no .
its not me . i swear . its her . shes magic .
nancy went bonkers from this thing . you wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic ?
ease off , john ..
then who oper@@ ated the store ?
rich . re@@ clu@@ sive . bank@@ rolls half a dozen charities .
okay ! he did . he pushed me to the floor and he did it to me . now , can i go home ?
but@@ --you love him , don't you , saunders ?
you've been very open with us . i mean , uh , your books and papers and ... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the commission .
thank god , austin , we made it .
no ! don't let go ... you mustn't ! i love you !
tough spot .
son .
no way . i've got to get out now .
you gonna dig up that lady's husband ?
agnes ...
why certainly !
yeah , just a cigarette got in a wa@@ ste@@ basket .
i was so excited about meeting you . again and again , i kept getting in the back of the line so i could be the last to talk to you .
came here to fire you , jerry .
fuck that , i mean , the heck with that . i kicked their ass ! well , i tried . there were two of them you know ...
mr . fit@@ ts , with all due respect , i think lawson needs the bijou a bit more than it needs a super market . and i think lawson deserves the bijou . there's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt ...
okay - -
hey ! you shouldn't be down there !
you mean for good ?
you're heading for trouble , fergus - -
i'll be alright . hurry up so we can get going ... we got our own boat to catch .
that sounds like rizzo having faith in some of that future shit .
told ya , didn't i ?
he insults him all the time .
very nice .
are you kidding , they love me . i'm a star , lee . a god to these people !
you don't know , do you ?
what's to sketch ?
what ? gimme a fucking break . is that what you think ? that your not big enough a deal for me ? jesus , gimme a little credit , rob .
you ... .
to me , it shows part of our history in this country , a time when we were considered inferior , sub-@@ human .
only that you're all tough un@@ delu@@ ded motherfuckers . and that it's not in your nature to let me go .
no . but i can bypass it with one of these
ready .
you're amazing .
well , why not ?
there are no charges against you . i'm here to decide if i'm going to represent you should that occur . did you kill him ?
and that is the last time any ...
that ain't much of a name .
how are you ?
you're too fucking late .
sure , why not .
what ?
nope .
and i don't like what we've become . i'll cover any losses you have on this one . now get out , you asshole !
it was quite war@@ ran@@ ted by the - situation . i realize this is a shock , but really , rowan - you never even knew her . it's not as if you've suffered some great -
... and live happily ever after .
aw , you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids . anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat , we're gonna forget all about this social stuff , and we're gonna be known as mr . and mrs . stew smith . how do you like that ?
no ... nor build bon@@ fires ... nor beat drums neither . i'll meet you on the far side .
the world is not thy friend , nor the worlds law . then be not poor , but break it , and take this .
one what ? ah-ha !
do you own a video camera ?
no . that's what i mean - i'm being fired for what i didn't do .
last line of gone with the wind ?
control on .
i like my horizons narrow .
i wasn't cheating !
well , that's one way of putting it .
where's lieutenant bar@@ ca@@ low ?
i'm sorry . i really shouldn't have - -
we have to tell mother and cal .
" closed , closed , closed . " but with your music .
does that include helen filmore , united states con@@ gre@@ ss@@ woman ?
no ... did megan say when she's coming back from her ... visit ?
damn baby , relax . i'm getting to it . from philadelphia following the route high@@ lighted to pacifica california - - you're traveling an estimated three thousand two hundred miles ...
i'm gonna nail you , nash . that's a promise .
okay .
relax . it will be fine .
show her a good time , but for god's sake restrain yourself .
a what ?
i don't know . i guess i like your stories .
listening to angels ?
i guess living up here makes people look older .
they drive so re@@ ck@@ lessly there .
my lisa . she went into thorwald's apartment , and he came back . the only way i could get her out was to call the police .
git up . i got sump'n to show you .
we've still got some dead weight to get rid of .
well--i don't see what's changed . no - p@@ da's , no ne@@ cking on the obstacle course .
i'm not a witch , i'm your wife . but after what you just said , i'm not even sure i want to be that anymore .
i won't say , no , wait , claudia - -
what the hell is wrong with you ?
no , where is it ?
you sonofabitch .
whenever an employee de@@ parts , shall we say , it's up to the head of his department to re@@ qui@@ s@@ ition his file , rea@@ ssi@@ g@@ n any outstanding claims , and send it off .
holds up a loaded fork . pauline re@@ lu@@ ct@@ an@@ tly takes it .
it was like tommy was possessed or something . there was a hate in his eyes that i couldn't really call human .
yes , we do . you're relieved , ensign . take over at ops .
i know . i know . i've seen a lot of kids die , too , in world war ii .
that right ? shit . i used to run ri@@ gs for a guy loved your cha@@ w there . shit rotted out his tongue , had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk . you ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue ?
two are still missing .
" hamburger heaven . "

did i tell you i'd call you a fascist dickhead ? !
we missed .
magic .
that's my fault , not hers . i've got to keep practicing . i'm still in the learning stage but magic , madmartigan , requires concentration and - -
to ... to kill them .
i'm trying to slash my wrists .
the song i was trying to hum . the song my friend , taught me .
he's not telling the truth .
okay .
what are you talking about ? this bar is packed with professional people ! everybody says if you're going to get married , this is the spot to meet someone ... luckily , i'm currently off men , so i've got the luxury of not giving a shit .
we can't just sit here , austin .
she had a cottage . one day , she was three months gone with child , so
save your strength .
... a mon@@ stro@@ s@@ ity ! who would do that ?
you and al lived together a few months before you got married - - after dad left .
soon young , don't worry . you will have many friends very soon . you will see . america is a very friendly place .
but , sir ...
i know that this was probably a great white shark . car-@@ ca@@ don ... cara@@ dan ...
you are the last jedi , luke . you are our only hope . be patient .
it's complicated ...
fire the whole division . we're moving more of the operations division into manhattan anyway . whoever is left over from the conver@@ sion is no longer needed . we already have all the key people here . anyone else is expendable .
there you are . out you come .
seventeen .
donowitz , he said .
what happened to you ?
do you know what you're saying ?
we like you , leon - - don't we like leon ?
do not interrupt ! ! ! do not speak lightly of the spice ... one small point ...
but it could have been glorious .
more than that .
... as a narcissist , he couldn't blame himself . he created the voices after the fact .
bye that was snow@@ ball .
then when ?
yes , ben - are you going to die now ?
fuck all that .
stop her !
it's just the dope , don't worry
i'm sure .
they asked who it was .
i'm sorry . who are you ?
i just heard . who is he ?
no . she's frightened . she doesn't know where she is .
hello ?
well , chum ? what now ? kiss the 85 thou goodbye ? pay some thi@@ e@@ f@@ 's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree ?
- i told you ! he was there ! -
i want to now who i'm talking to .
expecting visitors ?

i drive a taxi . you tried to get away one night . remember ?
what are you thinking about ?
they think you did it .
hey , au@@ gu@@ st@@ us , i need your help , i got a serious problem here . i'm not screwing around .
correct , and that's when - -
she says it's not .
will you stop riding me ? !
how many ?
that's their position ? you've certainly got them surrounded . i suppose they've neutralized all communications here .
nothing !
why don't ya then .
huh ?
how about your phone number ?
where's hap ?
you don't need to talk all macho , " shake him out , little bad boy . " whatever - - you're not an action hero , tough guy , you're not a gangster - -
fine . cor@@ k@@ scre@@ w's on the right .
no .
did you tell him you did ?
ted , divorce is a terrible thing . i know , i went through it . you've got to believe i did everything i could to get joanna to stay . but i'll tell you something . you may not want to hear it , but it took a lot of courage for joanna to do what she just did .
no , it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes . we got other things to do too , you know . he'll hurry her up . how's everything else besides this ?
michael - why would he want to hurt stu ... ?
let's have a look , shall we ?
no you're not , you just don't understand them . here , do what i tell you .
' cause i wanna catch her alone .
i want to know you .
take it and welcome ... but don't count on finding me here when you get back ... i've been dal@@ lying around this god-@@ for@@ sa@@ ken win@@ d-@@ sc@@ our almost two long years waitin ' for you ... i ain't cut out to be an old maid !
what pictures ?
' night .
call me .
what are you talking about ? i'm coming with you .
why ? you gonna do something about it ?
perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me philip ?
and what do we get out of it ?
put that phone down !
just a second . hello ?
but it was when you tried to persuade me the captain was guilty that i should have understood .
he's not finished .
the headless horseman - -
that sul@@ ky boy was here again this afternoon . i was almost scared , he wouldn't go away .
i'm sorry , mrs . lieberman - - and i'll never invite those people again .
you intended to bring your reserves across the river ?
business , best hidden is hidden best at night .
i was willing to shoot captain renault , and i'm willing to shoot you .
how do you know i'm not ? i was cruel to jessica . when i got to know her - - when i found out how empty and un@@ generous she was , there was something about her - - something smooth and false - - that made we want to hurt her .
well , i think i remember reading the report on that . wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million ?
other ships , yes . but no experienced commanders . captain , i need jim kirk .
ah , yes , which reminds me , who here thinks they'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs ?
i'll take it from here - - i am - -
wha@@ dd@@ up ?
did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way ?
if we have to see the porter we'd better go .
i also like bananas .
yes , but the <u> important </u> thing , as i've said ...
have you questioned him yet ?
do it ! now - - !
he did it to make you stay with him !
i'll bet he never jerks off ...
might be exciting for you .
- - when he wants someone run down , you're willing to do it for him .
tri@@ ad , chinese mafia . they bring people from y@@ un@@ an . slave labor ... reverend harry wong , a preacher had the flo@@ p@@ house fron@@ ting for them . no sign of him .
i'm just going to get some ice .
i wouldn't take that too seriously .
we wait and i'm a dead man . i got a black face , a criminal record , and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much i hated west - - my court martial will take six minutes . it's either me or them , ray , and you gotta decide right now .
but if truth was on your side , whatever were you worried about ?
really ? i'd like to find out .
alex ... people are staring .
sheriff deeds ' dead , honey@@ --you just sheriff junior .
okay ?
may <u> be </u> . there's kind of a dark horse now in the running .
and mr . kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office - - without overtime .
how long has he been with you ?
who is this , enid ?
be a friend . leave .
ah ... i do them myself . i used to work in a beauty parlor .
okay .
right now ?
i don't know the kid , and what little i do scares me .
that's not necessarily a bad thing .
and who says what is wrong .
well - ?
nick ...
look , i just want my life back . now whats it gonna take ? you wanna talk turkey ? lets talk turkey ! how much money ... ?
meaning i have to go defend a budget to the president and to congress and you're out here listening to washing machines .
i don't buy them anymore . you were the only one who drank them .
no .
this . i can't tell you how sorry i am !
and i take this <u> opportunity </u> to suggest that , equally , i admit to <u> nothing </u> , and that i would like my lawyer present .
so , there are rules . things you do and things you don't do .
it's okay . it's okay .
about charlie's leopard ?
but an oracle can .
attraction is a complication ?
such as ?
don't you get it ? in one day i earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue .
in the leg .
absolutely . listen , if you can't find any , it's okay . i just thought it might be nice .
then you're finished in show business .
do i look crazy ?
no call to . that jail looked pretty solid to me . how's she feel ?
it's a school night ... back by nine .
in the old series we didn't have a convertible .
da@@ d--@@ if my cur@@ ve@@ ball is hanging , god ain't gonna help me .
whatta you think ?
you see , i have this theory about men with glasses .
wha ' ... what are you doing here ?
i was going to tell him ... but in my own time . in my own time ... .
yes .
i miss beast a lot , too .
i don't feel like going to work today .
the comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already .
do you mind putting that gun away ? my wife doesn't care , but i'm in a delicate condition .
who did it ?
which <i> times </i> guy ?
they say i am no good to you .
not for long .
i know that . you think i don't know that ? " i know that's a dumb way to begin , but it's the only way i can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when i heard the two of you on the radio . on the other hand , maybe i'm just losing my mind . "
i won't waste your time and ca@@ ther@@ ine's time bargaining for petty privileges . clarice starling and that awful jack crawford have wasted far too much already . i only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl ... let me help you now , and i'll trust you when it's all over .
what i'm saying is she wouldn't go for that .
oh yeah . mr . by-@@ the-@@ book , sti@@ ck-@@ up-@@ the-@@ ass , my - wa@@ y-@@ or-@@ the-@@ highway death . believe me - over the course of eternity , you get pretty damned tired of <u> that </u> sch@@ tick . <i> </i> so i need a job . he sticks me in this bro@@ ke@@ -@@ down amusement park , with a buncha animals to run it . i'm supposed to be <u> grateful </u> ?
mo@@ th@@ balls , sir .
wait . did he see us ?
made it ... ?
souvenirs ?
everyone has been very kind . i am extremely grateful .
is he circu@@ m@@ ci@@ sed ? can you imagine what his anus is like ? describe it to me . would you like to so@@ do@@ mi@@ ze him ? would you like to put your penis right into his anus , thrust it up his anus ? tell me , describe it to me . tell me what you would do . how would you kiss him in that car ? describe how you'd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans , then take out his penis . would you kiss it or suck it right away ? which hand would you hold it in ? have you ever sucked a penis ? do you know what semen tastes like ? have you ever tasted semen ? some semen is sal@@ tier than others . va@@ u@@ gh@@ an's semen must be very salty ...
three kids . what's she going to do ?
c'mon , it all worked out . you came out okay in the end ...
she's my girl ... she's drivin ' ... that bother you ?
okay frank .
at school , she kept mostly to the japanese kids , and sort of ignored me . as if all of our times alone together ... in the hollow cedar , everywhere ... were a secret .
why no silen@@ cer ?
exactly . the ship's internal clock is off by seven years .
hey relax , i'm not gonna break it .
check the monitor , she's <u> fine </u> .
as i said , we can pay you in gold .
maybe you want my money , too .
no ... no ... no ...
i'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be . i deal with my own shit . i ain't asking anyone to bail me out .
don't have one .
oh .
you do know how to do that , don't you ?
no . these are her first steps . watch her .
not much .
one or two kilometers .
i'm married .
workin ' . pickin ' peaches . but i seen a bunch a fellas yellin ' when we come in , so i come out to see what's goin ' on . what's it all about ?
no . you're with who you should be . it's like she chose you .
a princess ?
you thought we were a different planet ? !
those are the two categories ...

so i understand you correctly . if the missiles in cuba were dis@@ man@@ t@@ led , returned to the soviet union , and a guarantee was made not to re@@ introduce them , the united states would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade cuba ?

i think you're kidding yourself , clara . i used to think about moving out , you know ? and that's what i used to say . " my mother needs me . " but when you really get down to it , that ain't it at all . actually , you need your father . you know what i mean ? you're living at home , and you got your father and mother there , and you can go on like that - - being a little girl all your life .
and it's great ! think what it was a few years ago and what it is now .

fats knew the game was in the clutch , knew he had to do something to stop ya . he played it smart .
because i'm a professional liar . i spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies . for my writing .
... always . the best dim sum , the best camping stuff ...
just admit it , caesar .
like we had a choice ? besides - - when you let the enemy think he's orchestra@@ ting the battle , you're in a position of power . we let him pretend he's calling the shots , and while he's busy setting up the plan , you have time to woo bianca .
i guess no one cares what i got a job .

six hours , huh ? well , that's your ship there . you're blue five . you stay glued to me . i don't want any independent operations out there . personally i think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this . this is no joy ride we're going on .
there's only one way to find out for sure . try to cancel the last speech .
aw that's easy . i want my life back . can you swing that , my brother ?

forsythe , forsythe ! what's wrong ? what's happened ?
the mountains ?
i am sitting .
well , i don't know if sorry can make up for it . i found your remarks highly offensive .
three days .
but , mrs . rand - -
maybe you should think about it .
tom said he'd take care of it .
what you do is take vengeance ! which is a sin against heaven !
why would they be illegal ?
sure .
so what are you saying , marlon , the whole thing has been in my head - - ?
no , sergeant , i got <u> no </u> <u> idea </u> with who . and i might add , that in another six weeks , a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here , & driving away for their christmas holidays with pe - op@@ le whose name i-@@ w@@ on@@ '@@ t-@@ know-@@ either ..
i'll expect you for dinner this evening , captain hamilton . for christ's sake , have a bath .
much better .
that's why i need your help . you said you were good .
it was going too fast .
heavens , no ! the owners don't like us to even talk about it . i hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight .
tough titty , it's mine now .
what is that ?
no !
yes . very much .
look , now i'm pumping you . i'm sorry . it's none of my business . it's just that you're not like the others .
i must confess he would look a bit silly , fighting his way to moscow and turning right around again .
it's too late .
no . tell me why .
wait a minute . wait . whatiya want ? for cryin ' out loud !
why do you think i keep her here ?
i promise i just gotta pick up one thing .
we've certainly been in some swell jams .
is that what you think ?
uhura , i had the strangest dream . i dreamt that a madman had taken over the enterprise .
across ninth avenue . dod@@ gi@@ e's . where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years . where uncle billy and uncle marty got their hair cut . where jim r@@ or@@ ty shot a man for cheating at poker .
probably . she's on the phone twenty - three hours a day .
irwin ...
uh-huh .
im@@ personally .
yeah . grab one of the cards behind you . call that number . it's my cell .
well , you know , you know , you know , the <u> point </u> is : i <u> can't </u> tell you . cause you haven't <u> been </u> there . you haven't <u> done it </u> . and that's all there <u> is </u> .
oh - - it's you again . what do you want ?
oh . the bullets .
but that's silly , child . seeing how you feel , why
father , that's enough now
thanks a lot .
i thought only hookers drank those things .
we gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do !
with me .
well , it's nothing really important , but it's annoying .
it's a bit more like how can we help you . bay area's become quite a hor@@ ne@@ t's nest in terms of subversive activities . and ... well mr . hoover wants to re@@ it@@ er@@ ate that the fbi will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can . on a strictly advi@@ sor@@ y basis ... of course .
take your hand out of there . slowly .
surprise ending . wouldn't want to ruin it for you .
how many bottles ?
great question ! ! in the east ... the far east ... when a person is sentenced to death ... they're sent to a place where they can't escape ... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head ... it could be days ... weeks ... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced ... this uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation , don't you think ? it's been a pleasure talking to you .
two ?
nothing , captain . if they're here , they're ri@@ gger for silent running .
simple . i have something you won't more than anything . the way to free you from the curse of the treasure . you have something i want - - more than anything .
yeah .
i'm just talking on the phone to you and standing .
good , travers . it might catch on , like shooting s@@ ke@@ et .
do you understand that ?
i don't be-@@ le@@ eve this .
what do they do up there ?
i want to work today , that's why i came ...
i can't .
you've got to stop them . please !
he doesn't return my calls . or my letters ...
eat it .
nothing at all ?
i did it ! i did it ! we won !
yes .
i'll see what i can do .
thank you , captain .
i don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner .
both you , idiots shut up , i can't understand shit ! now , what's happened , what's going on , and what are you talking about ?
are you sure ?
no one available .
" no , " what ?
you had no right . supposing i was doing something that couldn't be cancelled ?
hey bud ! finger here .
i took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach .
to preserve their way of life .

fergus .
goddamn it , sir ...
i guess you're , right . well , what do you say we get a little midnight snack ? theo's should still be open .
wait a minute . promise me something .
what's your plan , mack ?
forget him . he'll remain with his whores until someone calls him . you need to worry about people like <u> otho </u> . there are a lot of phony trance medi@@ ums . they usually can't make the for@@ mu@@ las work , but if otho stu@@ mbles on the right words in that handbook ... he could hurt you . as in - - <u> exorcism </u> .
you could always make it up to her .
he'll have to take a check . i couldn't find my wallet .
when this is over , we're just gonna take off , the two of us . take a vacation .
twenty minutes !
that's better . yes ?
walter !
hello , benjamin .
that's how we met . we're members of the international same name club . believe it or not , there are 8@@ 46 paul benjamins in america . but only two in the new york metropolitan area . that's how paul and i got to be such good friends . we're the only ones who show up at the meetings .
look - - you know who that is , captain - - you know what she's saying - - you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life .
my dear , it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout vienna as a singing prostitute for a turk .
thanks , but i'm fine .
you strike me with words as hard as steel .
who else you been to see ?
how can you say that when you don't know him !
yes , sir . the rift effects all long-range communications .
hyper@@ active little fuckers , too . tough to keep up with in a wheelchair , i bet .
well , that's what i knew then . or who i knew , i should say . you see , i was trying to court miss an@@ g@@ stro@@ m . i went to the meeting to impress her .
tom was telling me about his trip over . made me laugh so much i got a no@@ se@@ bleed .
the woman i saw you with ...

at least .
your son marty ?
don't get my hopes up . if i quit , what then ? i can't go through this again .
oh , yeah ! you and what army ?
not yet .
she had another name once .
i'm sure that's true , miss . and that's why we're doin ' what we're doin ' . what's happenin ' underground here is just what luci@@ fer planned for this sinful race o ' man . but we're gonna beat luci@@ fer . we're gonna put an end to what's happenin ' here .
you don't know ?
thanks , i do understand . i was worried about how that would be ... but now i'm not . and you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job .
yes , you did . they never tested you , did they ? but internal affairs knew .
we will assume full management of the colorado lode - of which you , mrs . kane , are the sole owner .
oh . ah , i'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am i ?

thanks .
... what a world .
look pal , i'm just askin ' how you ...

someone jumped on your car with their butt ...
oh no !
what do you know ? you wouldn't know the first thing about writing . you're the most ignorant person i've ever met !
playing dress@@ -up with cre@@ tin@@ s ? that sounds like a symptom of madness ; not its cure .

in here , mom ...
ok .
i was just thinking about my mom . she wouldn't leave him . i remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses . i mean it was dark outside and in . but we never talked about it .
uh ... none just now , but ...
they've confiscated all his other stuff . but this one's sorta left over . the regi@@ stra@@ tion's in the glove box , the keys were under the seat ... what's a matter , haven't you ever borrowed someone's car ?
owww .
i tear off the cover and paste this one on ... you know how it is .
open up !
they say you're in debt .
who do i play ?
they were children of our leading citizens , stars of the football team . and she was a loner . an angry girl that no one really liked . she'd called them ' queers ' .
i mean real money - - not counterfeit !
where's luc and pierre ?
follow every lea@@ d--@@ every lead goes somewhere - -

we're making a big investment in cuba . that's my only concern .

and you met mary how ?
there's something buried there .
i just can't find a nest . the root of the problem . i've looked everywhere . what's the russian for ant ? sorry that's a stupid ... sorry . this is strange isn't it .
hey ! where're you off to ?
well done .
mu@@ y bien !
we were satisfied .
sorry , kitty ! i'll be right back after i choke my monkey .
well , it won't work . love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a re@@ cal@@ cit@@ ran@@ t poet .
i'm glad . but what's all this ?
no , you see , i don't really love him .
he had nothing . he lived in a gar@@ re@@ t . his work was his life , he ...
i am so sorry ! forgive me , i - -
i'm very grateful to you , mrs . kendal . this is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal . john will be very excited .

y'ever get caught in a mistake king and you just can't get out of it ?
there are ? tell up . what are they , wise sir be@@ dev@@ ere ?
i never carry ... baggage .
it would never have worked , luthor . you are a dreamer - - a sick , twisted dreamer .
what's that supposed to mean ?
you won't believe it ! guess !
you can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff . three categories : you like me , you hate me , you want something from me . definitely third category .
well i got to watch myself these days . know what i mean ?
i thought that's what you said . you're from cleveland . and you were with the thirty-@@ sixth bomb group ?
yes - isn't it .
you move right along , don't ya .
there . oh , i like the feel of soil , don't you ? and the smell . it's the earth . " the earth is my body . my head is in the stars . " who said that ?
shut up . cuff him to the rail .
just now ...
while you eat , you look at the view .
bill ... ... where are you going ? to find eve ?
when you're arrested - - you're allowed one phone call ? who did you call ?
would you like to be ?
you're very flipp@@ ant and perhaps wise , but not wise enough to see the truth , louis .
who told you that ?
it's a strain of the plu@@ to@@ x@@ in 7 virus . genetically engineered . 100 % pure death . complete nervous system shu@@ t@@ down . you crash and bleed out like a stuck pig . not a pretty sight .
this ain't no cop .
right back to you .
but ... but ... she ... rosemary , i heard her voice ! it's her , i tell you , it's her !
then why bother curing me ?
well , there's a lot of boring stuff to do . lists of people we have to write to . find mama's relatives addresses in italy - - stuff like that .
well , that solves one problem . we don't have to worry about who to pay first .
oh , yes . absolutely . german . un@@ question@@ ably !

you never did answer my question .
why ?

fletch !
are you married , mr . - - ?
true , you're a lot hand@@ so@@ mer now . don't you have enough blood already ?
it's called self-@@ testing . but in your case , it sounds more like self-@@ destruction . a uni@@ que@@ ly human cha@@ ra@@ ct@@ eri@@ stic . in fact , human beings destroy things so well that i sometimes think that's our function . maybe every few sons , some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world , clears the decks , and lets evolution proceed to his next phase . maybe death and destruction are our job , maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that -
what time was that ?
why do they listen to guy ?
i respect your business , mister tony . every time we asked your help , we were very happy with the result . it's right this that makes me nervous , now . i hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood ?

what's that ?
where you going ?
you sure you weren't over on pine road ?
oh , right . baking powder , we need baking powder .

tell iris all about it . take good care of mrs . fin@@ ley , iris . beckett , come in .

would you like to take a turn around the deck with me ?
let's go , daddy . we have to check in . he was never appreciated at the institute .
the un is far away , dear sir . it is easier to make oneself heard with bombs . if i were in their place , i would use bombs .
the lieutenant wants the register .

those streets up in the hills , man . gotta be real careful , keep your eye on the ball . two o'clock in the morning , it's dark , your mind is all agitated , you're drivin ' a little too fast ... those curves don't kid around .
i mean it . oh , i know i always say i mean it , and then i don't - or you get me so i don't do what i say i'm going to - but -

i don't recall saying i didn't want a million bucks ...
bank robbery ? do you know what he does for ordell ?
my horse doesn't work .
how does it sound ?
is something wrong ? what's happened to your face ?
must be what we came for . the four stand slowly and enter through the doors , which close behind them . they begin walking around the waxworks , which appear gruesome . the first they spy is of a high school student with a letter jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry wood@@ s@@ man . they give each other looks of disgust and continue on . the next is of a fran@@ ken@@ stein-@@ e@@ squ@@ e creature carrying a woman in its arms . the four are now roaming around the waxworks indi@@ vi@@ du@@ ally , with tony en@@ counter@@ ing what appears to be a tribal indian pointing a knife towards a victim . mark walks past a circus cart with some sort of wer@@ e@@ beast inside , and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it . on the staircase is a zo@@ m@@ bi@@ e-@@ fied creature . we see china walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth . finally , we see tony walking up to a cottage room display .
yeah--@@ cri@@ pes . i never did get any sense out of alice . she found me holding up the old lady , dead as a mackerel . it was a bitch . you know--@@ maybe mrs . wheeler was going to die then and there anyway , even if i'd been the paper boy . maybe not . i dunno , boy . that's civilian life for you . who knows what kills anybody ?
what was inside ?
damn it , mom . i told you i need them all !
no , i'm not putting up with this .
have you accepted jesus christ as your personal savior ?
flip . you're the closest thing i got to a friend around here . tell me something . you think i'm crazy ?
i don't understand .
who am i thinking of ?
i guess we're in for it .
oh . well perhaps you could introduce us anyway .
i believe you're right , boss .
what is this interest you've got in her ?
it was too noisy .
you are , lewis . you rolling ?
it's not worth it . be with them instead .
karen . where are you ? i been trying to get a hold of you .
yes , and just one time can be enough . thank you .
see@@ in's how you're about as thick as a used string of un@@ waxed dental floss , don't know how you can criticize .
who was your teacher ?
never mind , you don't want to know about it .
that's fine , mr . ke@@ sher . you can pay cash when you check out . i'm sorry . it was my duty to inform you .
back in a minute , jody
i thought this was your dream come true .
what do you suppose anybody wants ? money , money , money !
dogs ?
you don't wanna be noticed ?
okay . i know you've been scared . now you want to scare someone .
who are you ?
don't mention me .
since she has re@@ pen@@ ted , all she does is throw stones .
you tricked me , damn you !
from what i've seen , mr . galvin , you have a very good case ...
i got an awful toothache .
come on . kids love horror .
you ordered me to kill my brother .
i don't ...
there is no privacy in russia . this whole thing seems very suspicious . what's the real reason ? if you ever want to get into russia , take my advice ... confess !
better late than never . korean war hero , sheriff for near thirty years - - buddy deeds memorial p - -
charlie , please don't -
you know those shotguns i sold ya , well i need ' em back .
he's looking for something . won't stop until he finds it . sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want .
the " deal , " forget the deal . forget the deal , you've got something on your mind , jim , what is it ?
what the fuck , man ? what do you people want ? i did what you was@@ i'@@ cu@@ 's told me to do .
i didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows - -
it's how i hear it . the dis@@ pla@@ y's just a little something i programmed for a@@ stron@@ o@@ mers with the misfortune of sight .
oh .
gone ?
yeah ? i better see some money out of it .
hey ! now there's some good news .
what's insane is the fact that micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet . that's insane .
he says he feels safe here .
where is he ?
bring her home ... i guess .
i don't know how to thank you .
oh , wait . one sec . open the window .
jesus christ ! ! you crazy people ...
what'd you buy at harrison's ?
no--@@ i--@@ i'll take a walk - -
i can't make it . you go on , master luke . it doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account . i'm done for .
you'll be fine .
saturday ?
call her .
sir ! they voted me most likely to succeed !
guys , guys ! come on , if this is anyone's fault , it's mine . i was the one who grabbed tri@@ p's jacket by mistake . it's my fault and i apologize .
hey !
i'm fine .
look , i'm stuck on the freeway . i think there was some big accident . it could be a little while so i don't want you to start freaking if i don't get there at exactly , eight thirty .
would you really , sam ?
he's already dead .
oh , i know . don't worry , ed . i came to tell you ...
that's why we're turning off onto a fire road .
what the hell has that got to do with anything ? tell me what's happening ? !
no thanks .
what's all this for ?
you must remember that bad business out there . about ten years ago ...
you kill me , you sign your death warrant . and hers .
father . you sure she's the supreme being ?
you know , you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
no .
mickey told him to call . ' he's some very hotshot surgeon at mass . commonwealth . he wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of deborah ann kaye . you meet him at the hospital . '
goodness .
why'd you do it ?
i got married . i didn't want to . it all happened so fast .
sez who ?
keep that thing away from me .
you're never too old for a lo@@ lly . i'm having one .
but what ?
nothing .
you want to know why ? i'll tell you why ... another scotch and soda for the gentleman . i'll tell you exactly why . because you're not his buddy anymore . because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him .
you and me , roy . what a team we'll make . we think alike ; we get along together . once or twice a year we take some slob , the rest of the time we live like this . you won't regret this , roy .
don't need to think fast to handle beer .
what're you talking about - - i'm not a dope fiend ! i saw it ! i'll show you !
guilty thoughts . see what happens when you cheat on me , even in your mind ?
hey , anything for a friend . how's the knee ?
bye !
elaine - - that is not what happened .
he's gone . he stole the car .
it's stupid to lie to me , miss schmidt . i'm in a position to help you .
i never knew you , dad .
she's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 3@@ 3 years .
yah , well , they exist all right .
yeah , we're down .
that's news to me . i'd better cable my wife .
that's when you take advantage .
go ahead .
this has everything to do with me dewey . i was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway . i'll be damned if i'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again .
it has no nobility .
well ... actually , no bill ...
maybe . recognize this ?
what ?
i'm moving out .
he was killed doing something he saw in the movie . it was terrance and phillip ... they killed kenny .
... who ... ?
i was on the team at school . i was never very good , though .
i like the noise .
yes . yes , of course . naturally , not those four .
not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking . you seemed as if you liked to talk . i like to let people talk who like to talk . it makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are .
how do you know ?
and now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
- - i'm probably not gonna go though .
there's something i gotta take care of . something i need to tell you about .
so you have your small victory , now what ?
she was dirty and wet ...
yes , sir .
no , i'm serious . give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell .
oh yeah ?
okay , sure . i might be tempted . especially now , since i'm getting out of the bail bonds business .
john , i know all about it .
we want that money - - now !
maybe .
if i'm not taking you away from anything .
ar@@ right ... enough ... i can't have you bell@@ ying up to my heart again , man , f you can't help falling off the stool . but he puts his mouth to her ears ...
i don't want your fucking money !
you work the system right , you could ask her yourself . just be thankful you're not working for household . the queen never lets them out of her sight . but wee spats like us can slip through the net , easy .
i hear you mac and i appreciate it . frankly i don't know what i'd have done without you on this one .
- - and that he changed his will ?
i'm sorry ? i don't get it .
be gentle .
are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here ?
you mean the snake ?
always has been .
you've been married twice - -
wolfi !
why don't you come back with me ?
my secretary ?
can i use some ?
not with any certainty we ...
yes , i understand . thank you .
what ?
i wonder if you're aware of the trust you en@@ danger , jean-luc picard . in my experience , it's unusual for ...
i feel as if you haven't heard anything i've been saying to you .
cru@@ tch ?
were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation ?
wait till you reach thirty - five before you blow your suit ...
i tried to teach him right from wrong just like i did his junior .
hi , ben . what are you doing with yourself these days ?
this tie cost more than your entire wardrobe .
what kinda music do you like ?
i said , do you come here often ! ?
smoke . rumors . i've heard stuff about a death squad . a group a guys loyal to the hard@@ line school . guys that@@ 've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks , su@@ spending cops right and left , tying their hands ... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people@@ 're squealing save us , save us , do something you fucking morons , crime is totally out of control .
can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right ?
what are the rules for a sweater vest ?
no .
all right , damn you ! all right ! give me a minute to inform my crew .
situation .
don't be sorry . help me .
what -
skin cancer .
i like that ...
who speaks that name !
nice to meet you .
someone was expecting that .
mr . harris doesn't check out until tomorrow .
have i said something a@@ miss ?
says who ?
the fitting room . there's a sign over the door .
better than i remembered .
you should have helped her without being asked .
what for ? who are you ?
gonna lose everybody out here ...
i'm sorry things went so wrong today .
he's been gone a long time .
he doesn't scare me . i'll kick his ass in .
my business , will . as for your business - - one question , or there's no use going . this girl - - what does she mean to you ? how far are you willing to go to save her ?
nevertheless , i'd like to see you in my office monday morning .
eu@@ re@@ ka ammunition company , gentlemen . your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight . gloria , i could go for you in a big way . however , the rifles you sent were a little rusty and i don't say that to everybody . have not received last month's drawing account ; how come your neck is like a swan . yours very truly ...
i will continue with our french allies , concentrating on new york .
goodbye , mother .
accident ?
maybe she has .
this is my first time at the white house . is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it ?
so many unanswered questions . why was she buried there . and who killed her ?
do you have t . p . ? t . p . for my bun@@ gho@@ le ?
i was hoping for a kind word , little sister .
i'm ok .
- - they hadn't pulled me off that woman i would have jerked a knot in her .
what'd he say ?
just keep it up .
we're here . where the hell are you ?
and if it is ?
you're really cra@@ mping my style here .
she'll come back . that's why i'm going to ... to not have this baby .
i stand corrected mr . decker . navigator , lay in a con@@ ic section flight path into the cloud center ; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there ...
oh , well ... i guess you ... in high school , you were a pretty good first baseman . and we were on the debate team together . but ... i think you were gonna run the bijou . you were brought up there , and you loved it so much . and i think you knew how much the town needed a place like that .
d'you ask the patient when did she last eat ?
it's dark in there . penelope and that's where he is !
yes .
right , well , thanks for the drinks and stuff , amanda , but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore .
because when we get down there - -
it's bullshit . you know it is .
there could be problems with something like that mister wallace . what if ... ?
yeah ... he and my father used to ride together back in the thirties ... fox hunting ... before i was born ...
kristen ...
your secret admirer ?
scream .
i must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect !
squash it .
it can't be .
decidedly . yesterday i was greatly amazed when i came from the market and found that you had made your bed , sir .
' nam o@@ yo ran@@ ged k@@ yo . ' you think it's dumb of course .
your suit is fitted desert fashion . who told you how to do that ?
no .
yes sir .
listen ! hear that ?
that's not ... it's not like that .
you should have seen geor@@ gi@@ e's face when he met clayton .
i can see that you're still very bitter about us , but in the interest of science , i'm going to give it my best shot . let's go to work , boys .
i'm just concerned about my daughter .
no .
what the hey . let's go for a drive .
you could say that .
fuck him - let him out !
maybe you'll understand this , because you know john , but he confu@@ ses me sometimes .
well ... come on .
of course not , that swedish thief ! he's a thief of hearts ! i love you , gabrielle .
you trust me to keep your money , but not to take your picture ?
good . so did i .
well , there were two sco@@ tch@@ men . one was named mcintosh and one was named mcgillicuddy . they met on the street .
you talk as if i were asta .
material made from self-@@ re@@ gu@@ lating unstable molecules . i've been working on a formula for this .
sir ?
you take the microwave ?
- - he won't .
still trying to make the world safe for our kind . still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves - - defin@@ iti@@ ve@@ ly .
not tonight .
include me in that .
twelve years younger .
i asked them to give me a couple minutes ...
you should think about getting professional help .
oh , i'm sure i can .
i cannot love you for the sake of revenge .
don't count it ... it's all there .
who's fighting ? why are you so defensive ?
what if sha@@ ri@@ 's the dream ?
well i pull out the manual on their setup , which is the new 6@@ 80 ser@@ ver ...
captain , we're receiving transmission from paradise city . they're demanding to know our intentions .
you think my play is bad ?
i'm not going to tell you that . i wanted that e - ticket . i wanted it so bad i'd stare <u> you </u> right in the face to get it - and i'd do the same again .
excelsior closing to 4,000 meters , sir .
you were right : it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation . you might have died .
i've got balls like watermelons , i'm telling you .
keith , if anybody comes in here and asks for me , you let me know . right ?
high mag , mr . sulu !
what the hell are these ?
i'd throw everything away for you .
the lunch hour . he probably worked it out in advance . he found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here .
grace , i need you to come with me .
i'm stuck ...
as we near the pole ...
what wouldn't last ? what's the matter with you ?
- - here we go - - i found it - -
right there , bobbie .
i wanted to be sure of something , general - - something that has always pre@@ yed on my mind . i have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - en@@ to@@ mb@@ ed imprisoned ..
cut his fucking throat .
frankie fer@@ che@@ tti introduced us once , about five months ago .
fine .
ok .
it's not your house - -
well , there it is , isn't it ? you don't even like them , and you'd sleep with them . what's that all about ?
look , i've got a wife . i don't care if either of you ever get caught .
you're just doing your job .
those can be adopted - -
of course not . it's so easy you almost feel sorry for them .
and he's a perfect stranger to me .
when you're older . . .
you better have a warrant . that's my notebook , you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it .
you know , he's been wanting a mit@@ t .
that would indicate he's playing out a fantasy . power@@ -@@ control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them . once they become a reality though , they reach a sense of eu@@ ph@@ ori@@ a and need to repeat the act to sustain it . but , in all the research i've read on serial killers , i've never heard of one moving so fast . it's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders - - not the other way around .
it is only ours you can know .
thank you , ma'am ...
you're too goddamned paranoid .
what did you say ?
he let the fucking cop out - - but he won't - -
there's not much illegal .
this evenin ' i want you to go get mizz wheatley and that frank and have them stay with you tonight .
it was here . at his car . i was coming back from a job and spotted you together . you seemed caught . i waved . you gi@@ gg@@ led .
now everything's fine . she's probably squawking her head off in some police station .
of course . only i'm afraid you'll be cheated . there isn't much of a view of the procession here .
and tomorrow morning you will have won your bea@@ ch@@ head on the shores of immortality ...
tonight i'm feeling lucky ..
about a year and half ago .
claudia ! ! !
the world series . you called bu@@ for@@ d's homer .
is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child ?
basically , its my car now . get in .
you bastard ! god ! i should've known . you wanted the cure all for yourself !
i do not .
hm .
who are you ?
sodium a@@ my@@ tal , maybe some other truth agent .
what are we gonna hear ?
note that she said ' pretty clearly ' . not ' clearly ' .
soda . you got any soda ?
you told me no calls .
yeah , yeah . i saw the commercial .
how can he make any trouble for me ? i haven't done anything .
i guess i see the tea@@ cup as a symbol for wo@@ manhood , because of tea parties in the o@@ l@@ d@@ en days , but instead of tea i was trying to kind of confront people with this ... like ...
if they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in . how can we rely on them ?
where the hell am i gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour ?
it is for that he hates me .
you're drunk - -
anyone got another set of sails ?
i don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't ?
because somehow they knew i was getting close . look , it's narcotics ... they make dope out of chemicals ... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars . they'll do anything . and they can get away with it because they're cops .
it's coming .
the other families won't sit still for all out war .
sure i do . but the bet defense is a good offense , right ? you're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game .
well , i can see this is pointless ...
i don't .
what about jewelry ?
i have faced him . have you ?
i don't see anything .
that's true .
i'm sorry , but you're not my type .
yes , we do . you're relieved , ensign . take over at ops .
you're mad . why are you mad ?
no , no , no , no , no , no . . .
int . brynner's van - day .
draggin ' the name of the lord through the evil mud of his soul !
jos , that's not what we're - -
that's sean ? jeez , he's a giant .
i'm concentrating on my career right now .
i want you to stop seeing her .
well i parked illegally . see y'@@ later ?
why ?
not here tonight . wasn't here last night . he's especially not back in his office .
i've had quite enough or i wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers . aren't peter's illusions to your liking ?
- - there's nothing to explain . you're trying to kidnap what i've right@@ fully stolen . - - - 43 .
i'm not going to " do " anything , i promise . but you need help , james . none of this is what you think it is .
your brother was up here the other day . he said you ran away from home .
what do you do best ?
... you have to sack me . i understand , sir . i'll go quietly . in fact i'll go right now .
thanks .
we're in motion on something .
sulu !
i hate ignorance and stupidity .
if ye want more tricks , i'm your man , but for big questions ye must go elsewhere .
john , what a surprise . i expected to be seeing you , not talking to you over the phone .
he's insane !
that's right .
i guess inside . or he never made it . either way , i don't give a shit . let's get this over with .
wonder why he doesn't fly both ways .
oh , god , how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere .
no other possibilities ?
thought he might be co@@ ol@@ in ' it in the bon@@ e@@ yard - - could either double-@@ back to the ship or slip in behind us . so i left the bottle out as bait .
the real@@ tor@@ 'll be here tomorrow in the morning . the house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the london flat .
prisoner exchange .
it's nothing to do with you . it's me they wanted , not you . why do you interfere in other people's business ?
nothing much - - just that it might not be a cat this time .
okay ...
yes , w@@ inter@@ 's coming . i don't like the winter ,
no pictures , either .
it is not necessary . they will not follow .
he can remember at least one occasion - - and the receptionist can recall two times when she ac@@ comp@@ ani@@ ed marsh to the office .
it's all right with me if she teaches you , but i don't want you for@@ gettin ' your job .
yeah .
am i in there ?
what ?
mistake ?
i love you .
i've no influence with mr . holland .
put it back on my head . i'm falling apart here .
harlin's .
hey look at this !
lydia liked me , you see . that was the strange part of it . in fact , now that i'm no longer a threat , we're very good friends .
don't move me .
true .
i wish she hadn't .
seriously ?
you tried to fuck me in my father's office , you sick bastard . look , vic , whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home , go do it . but don't try to fuck me . i don't think of you that way . i mean , i like you a lot -
that's a be@@ t--@@ but i couldn't let you walk out like that , sally . i'd have gone cuckoo back there@@ --just thinking about you - -
of course ... it's wonderful .
mmmm , possibly . yes . but public opinion has a way of changing and you , alex , if i may call you , alex ?
charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery .
what's he sayin ' ?
yes . yes , justin , we heard it .
no ... i want to be confessed .
al@@ an-@@ one . he calls me ... may i pass ?
anyway , you're crazy .
and what in your estimation works ?
miss vivian .
why ?
no , your mother did , then i did after she passed .
yeah , how do i know ?
two days . an hour or so .
i'm seventeen . i know it like the back of my hand .
really ?
what should i do ? call the cops ?
uh huh .
the telephone calls ... we know about that .
i gave him this new face .
is that mandrake , lord merlin ?
no .
yeah ?
that's how you eat ? it's like a ger@@ bi@@ l .
oh , no .
and then you ...
just that rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business - cri@@ pp@@ ling nazi youth shop@@ li@@ f@@ ters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary . that's all .
ah , brenda ... mrs . peel ?
no , i'm just calling you ... a guy who has my flask .
i call him a monster .
well , mom's dead , so shut your fly trap .
counselor . what can i do for you ?
so@@ mb@@ itch and i ain't never been to be@@ an@@ town .
quite right !
relax . i've flown with my old man a million times . and he always told me , the taking off part is easy , it's the landing you've got to worry about .
come on nigga . sup , sup then ? stop faking moves .
what's your name ?
yup ! worked right outta de@@ po@@ e bay for just about every season since i was able to haul my own weight .
yes . i haven't lived . i've died a few times .
uh , sure .
i'm sure you mean something by that , addison , but i don't know what ...
- - doubtful , mrs . lea@@ vit@@ t . the main thing to remember is , whatever the reason , it was for the best - - it meant something was wrong .
my problem is i got a fifty-@@ year-old lust and a three-@@ year-old din@@ kie .
you walked out on a job for me , and i won't ruin that .
keep firing !
i'll teach these po@@ dun@@ ks what happens when they challenge the righ@@ te@@ ousness of progress .
no , jennifer love hewitt . of course it's me , silly . and i feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself . where are you babe , the movie starts in twenty minutes .
interesting .
a chicken ?
strap yourself in , sweetheart , we're taking off !
maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape . maybe they still plan to grant your request , only in their own way , in their own time ... or maybe it's just like you said : ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology .
don't tell me we gotta go back out there ?
... that's the general idea .
i've been in prison , remember ?
no . you killed her . manager remembers you going into her room . your fingerprints were found all over the place .
yes , louise . i have seen it often . it happens to old people .
it's not much money , but it's enough to live on . you'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room .
i ain't neither . listen here , buddy , besides all his vast medical knowledge , he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts - - he wants justice in the world and he's got some real interestin ' ideas .
i'm sure i - -
don't you want me to ?
i will finish what i've begun
i got there from " coin , " dude . coin , coin ... k@@ wa@@ aa@@ an .
daddy , he's coming back ... krueger's coming back . make them understand .
of course not .
what ?
there's more people moving ea@@ st@@ bound down old reservoir road past the elementary school .
that it was all an accident . she wants to hear it from mi@@ chea@@ l's mouth .

there's a certain amount of information there .
that was my last .
your friend's all business .
don't play dumb . you know what i'm talking about .
flan@@ king riders ?
... frozen ! so if you don't mind - - !
because you wanted to give my wife back to me ? why should that mean anything to you ?
go , sulu .
then again , your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now ... i think this is a secret just between you and your mom .
i'm sorry . i didn't want to sound cynical . but isn't it better to look things squ@@ a@@ rely in the eye ?
my lord mother man , you look like hell . what were you drinking ?
what happens when we run out of wood ?
as long as he keeps his throat clear , he is able to get some rest .
if you'll pardon the expression , that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly . good night .
just a minute .
and leave me down here ? ? ?
c'mon , c'mon , that's it ...
- - alleged crime - -
you don't . he finds you . through his people .

yeah . okay . be home around seven . bye . what ? i'm sorry . what was i supposed to do ?
i cannot believe you are saying this ? you , who i have reli@@ ed on all this time - -

nothing .
so who ... whos the man ? where is he ?
you don't have to tell me if you don't want to , but i might be able to help .
huh ?
this ain't the time .
what - - ?
a mor@@ ay eel ... a mor@@ ay eel ...
deanna , stand by . open a channel .
some of them are .
i-i read a poem of you and thought of his last week . a poem of his and thought of you last - - you'll be fine , though . lee walks over to elliot in the center aisle . she looks at the book .
... me , yeah . and she likes tommy la@@ sor@@ da . case closed .
gee , i don't think . . .
no , i'm not afraid . tell ! shout it from the house@@ tops ! and remember this - - they hanged burke - - they mobbed hare - - but dr . knox is living like a gentleman in london .
that's very funny , sir . you are under arrest .
oo@@ ok . oo@@ ok .
brooke , i believe you . but a jury is gonna want an alibi .
here . sit down ! quiet , egghead ! all right , now , a serious expression .
don't ask what you can do . no co@@ ddling . life rolls on status quo .
what happened ? oh my god ...
your wife ?
was it okay ?
jesus , sally . you are a medical miracle . the only person who's ever taken ec@@ stacy and become an@@ gri@@ er .
objection !
tell her i'm not here , tell her ...
i don't know .
i want to make that come to life - - yes , and lighted up like that , too - - for every boy in the land . boys forget what their country me@@ ans@@ --just reading " land of the free " in history books . and they get to be men@@ --and forget even more . liberty is too precious to get buried in books , miss saunders . men ought to hold it up in front of them@@ --@@ every day of their lives and say : " i am free@@ --to think@@ --to speak . my ancestors couldn't . i can . my children will . "
so we passed some kind of test ?
i need her ; she's a cop . i have to kill a cop , and then ...
she was right behind me , i turn around , she's gone . she could be anywhere .
look , you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again . we're watching her very carefully ... this woman has been into lau@@ dan@@ um . it's a controlled experiment , but i suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over .
umm .
right . now look : i want you all to be very careful . this is ter@@ ra inco@@ gn@@ ita . many customs will dou@@ b@@ t@@ less take us by surprise . it's a for@@ gone conclusion these people have never seen an ex@@ tra@@ -@@ ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al before .
i got up .
i ain't interested in his mental condition . all i want to know is , is he d ' n d or is he a canary ?
no , billy . i'm the one who's been selfish and self-@@ absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress .
not half as bad as i feel .
it's amazing that your sweet , lovely , gorgeous wife can ever get to see you .
and for all that dough i don't do nothin ' ?
thank you , mr . murphy . we'll let you know .
yes .
i'm sorry i didn't believe you .
very much .
z ! over here !
and what ? what ? she was driven from her home , by albanian terrorists . it is her we are mo@@ bi@@ lizing to defend ... it is " she " ?
what do you want ?
rick , i'll put my cards on the table . i think you know where those letters are .
what for ? we've got a job to finish ... why are you making the monitor ?
let me review here : you're ... what are you ... you've ... it's all over between us ?
now , mother , a body can't help their fe@@ el@@ in's .
this ellingson security creep . i gave him a copy of the disc you gave me .
you'd better get out of here ! kevin's coming back !
karl , what in the world are you doing here ?
there'll be people in that casino . i can't keep them from leaving if i don't get a gun . i don't need bullets , monster ... but i gotta be a threat .
how did you know that was me ?
he's been coo@@ ke@@ d-off
a visual record , yes . a be@@ for@@ e-@@ and - after kind of thing . this could make your reputation .
so i was replaced by mitch ?
it depends on what way you want to go .
who - -
rhodes , you and i had a roll in the hay together when i first got here . it was a who@@ lly un@@ satisfying experience which i do not want to , and which i never will repeat ! so give up , mister ! i'm going home ... to that roommate you mentioned .
the guy's in a coma , bob .
fine ! eat in the cupboard .
no offense , pal , but i just don't think you're built for it . these he - men@@ 'll kick your ass ! ! they're huge !
what else you got ?
when do we start ?
my bed .
you take care of yourself then , betty , and don't let anybody stop you ...
that i did it again .
two .
no . what ?
don't think so .
just your age .
my kind of place . i always liked country boys .
well , i guess i take after you then !
remember ... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm ... it'll go to the thumper .
and live in what , our station wagon ?
quite , absolutely - i always thought they were false .
you got more guts than me , baby . it's a no-good town .
the first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle .
you do what he says , harold .
but aren't you tired ? i can just about manage to stand on my feet ! raimondo !
well , then forget all this stern dad stuff .
i knew that if these were the guys i was looking for , i'd have to set up a deal so sweet , they wouldn't be able to walk away from it .
now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin ' but a army cot and a toilet back there .
that was big of him .
i love you .
let it ride for a while .
hey , sig - can we talk to you ?
just wanted to let you know .
what's her greatest fear ?
they're awfully heavy .
well , he was making love to her .
you didn't hear ?
i could do it if i tried . even kelly thinks so .
sure dear , yes .
oh dear .
alright , let's take a vote ...
that's great .
i thought it over , and you were right . you wanted me out of the rackets , and now - -
patient apparently suffers from acute ob@@ se@@ ssion@@ al syndrome with potential homicidal styles . work better for you ?
not nervous ? relaxed ?
what's wrong ?
he's at nor@@ star .
holy christ . you want to get us killed ?
finally , some gratitude .
i know it's a lot .
what do you mean ? what kind of person am i ?
of course . of course .
a loser ?
sir !
why ? your mother not breast feed you or something ?
what ?
you wish .
er ... yes ...
yes ?
shut up ! butt@@ lick !
i'm saying , cy@@ n@@ thi@@ a's po@@ mer@@ ani@@ an . i'm looking after it while cynthia and marty a@@ ck@@ er@@ man are in hawaii .
no , you see , i <u> promised </u> them ... i have to ... i have to go and ...
going somewhere , margie ?
he was trying to get into my apartment and ... i know this sounds gross but i was so turned on . i grabbed him and kissed him !
you ... i've seen you around the base . but you ... you're not army , are you ?
when me and sissy were kids , we were just like you two .
gambling ! i'd like that . i have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me .
honey .
alright .
nay . jack's the dra@@ gon@@ -@@ slayer , ain't you , jack .
can you ?
small , blond , good-looking . she was with him when we met . she had a funny english accent .
i'm not sayin ' i'm not in love with you .
where are they going ?
yes .
what do you mean ?
we gotta go underground . get those guys out , now .
my colors ?
she ... she died . it's like it just happened .
thanks . i thought you weren't gonna ...
you bet , doc !
no , my lord .
well , this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tin@@ i@@ est molecular disturbances .
huh ? ...
what's in florida ?
we don't know . west is dead .
pull your pants down .
i used to . with my old man . he taught me how to hunt and trap . tra@@ pp@@ ing's a lot harder than most people think . we used to go after ra@@ c@@ coons mostly . they'd get into our garbage , our fields . when an animal can't live peacefully with those around it , it has to be destroyed . but they're cra@@ f@@ ty little devils . you see the trick is , you can put your trap down , but no raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent . you ever smell raccoon scent ? smells like shit , but to a male raccoon it smells just like pussy . he'll walk right up to that trap , even though it don't look nothing like a raccoon and stick his goddam head right in it . you know why ? cause he can't help himself . the scent drives him . so , if you want to catch a raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is - - lay down the scent - - and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap .
what do you mean ? mommy ? you're scaring me !
en@@ chan@@ te .
- - barry , if i were to say to you i haven't seen evil dead ii yet , what would that mean ?
no ! it's three o'clock . that can only mean one thing .
well , it's actually reincarnation , but you get the idea . and some people think we just wink out ... like a candle flame when the wind blows hard .
no .
as commander in chief , i have ordered our army to set up defensive positions along the u@@ s-@@ canada border in an@@ ti@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion of an attack .
last two like this we had , you caught .
does it have a human name ?
you'd better be quiet , sandy .
- - i don't know - -
so you're in ?
in the trunk ?
what ?
that wasn't me .
colonel munro sent him . he was one of our mo@@ hawk allies .
sonny ? don't send me away ! i can help you save your soul ...
oh gawd , oh yes , it's never been better . never better ! !
you judas ... bloo@@ d-@@ sucker ...
tried to . de@@ fa@@ ul@@ ted on their payments .
not so good . he wouldn't listen to reason . he stole my car ... my porsche ... i can't find it anywhere ...
why , you need me for the story ?
yeah , but not seriously . christ , you're ready to walk down the aisle - i'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody .
what is it ? anything wrong ?
andy , c'mon in ! thanks for flyin ' out here ! !
you know , i had a crazy dream last night . it was about you .
is that a trick question ? c'mon , i can't be the only one who thinks this is cool .
i'm terrible at this . i blur@@ t . i'm a blur@@ ter . your parents ... they ... well ... they exist no further . skin@@ n@@ y-@@ dipping . the amazon . pi@@ ran@@ has . it wasn't pretty .
he's been altering the coordinates since we logged on . he's a step ahead . let's jump to #@@ 12 .
that would be thi@@ ba@@ dea@@ ux . the cop i work for every now and then . catching thieves . the really good on@@ es@@ --the ones who imitate me .
yes . it would be .
yeah , i guess so . it was the strangest thing . i knew what i was doing but i couldn't stop . this really terrible feeling came over me and - - i don't know - - i just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all . whew ! sorry , boys .
oh , he said rim job . it's when someone licks your ass for -
oh what a maze . isn't it beautiful .
you have your nerve ! here , boy !
are we free , buljanoff ?
max is a good idea . he can help with my luggage . thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe . and thanks for the use of all the trinkets .
where are you , ... al ?
leo fast elk ... is alive .
" don't write any checks you can't cash . "
karla .
wyant wheeler represented us .
oh ...
jack , if the rumors hold and israel is really the great white whale of s@@ nit@@ ches , then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psycho@@ tics into the mix to do just that . so what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace , when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain pre@@ lu@@ de to doom .
yes ?
nothing i wouldn't be please to be rid of .
i have need of friends .
that bothers you ?
you were meant to you're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to .
they're good guys ... have you seen holly ?
what , the lunatic who - -
i'm serious .
you've got to have the right ladder for the job . you don't know what you're doing , you can get yourself in trouble .
deb , i want to throw you a shower .
clarence says we gotta be hittin ' it .
they have done ... nothing ... they are my people ...
you must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate . not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered , but also because you are helping us .
it doesn't make any sense .
i don't know about that plantation angle .
doc it's janet .
what are those things ?
don't make conversation with me .
what did he say ?
who ? who is here ?
you've made it from the gu@@ tter@@ most to the u@@ pp@@ er@@ most . don't you know you should never let them see you sweat . y'knowwhati'msayin ' ?
dude dude dude , i gotta talk to you a minute , listen listen listen . i copied a garbage file from ...
i have a loft .
that's good thinking , baxter . next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here - - and as far as i'm concerned , you're executive material .
give that a try .
no . you can't trust her .
so you slept o . k . ?
az@@ ra@@ el can you repeat that ?
don't bring that up . like a different girlfriend would@@ '@@ d@@ 've let you die ?
stop crow@@ din the plate !
it frightens me .
you was our first supreme commander , terry . keep out of sight and i'll tell him you're out .
i said that ? look , i'll take it for five , and you'll make out okay , because in this case it's pure cream , you don't have to cut anything back to the w@@ ear@@ er .
i . yes . it is .
sorry if i spoke out of turn .
yes .
let's go - - we're running two minutes late .
i see ... and why are you experiencing this paranoia ?
i don't know about water bu@@ f@@ fa@@ lo@@ es , but i know about him . he's kind and sweet and considerate . he wants a home - - and children .
what else ? shit , principal cole , you ain't gonna believe what else .
i don't ...
we agree .

i'm pulling the green wire .
you're a fuckin ' mess .

of course .
yeah , maybe .
well - - where ya goin ' ?
dating anyone ?
i can't say it out loud . i don't use bad language .
i'm not about love - - i'm about " showing you the money . "
how do we follow a raven we can't even see ?
is it wednesday ? it's wednesday . how embarrassing . i don't know what i was thinking . with all the excitement lately ... am i interrupting something ? are you expecting company ?

i must be stern with you .
your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it .
i'll be on board by noon .
it's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent .
ain't it just ? the man who invented beer , louis , that man was having a prime day for himself .
freddie was so happy for me when i got this job . this - toaster gi@@ v@@ ea@@ ways , and barry mani@@ low on the speakers all day - she thought this was really hot shit . what did she know , big dummy ...

good night , mr . baxter .
oh , he's not the man for you . i can see that . but i sort of like him . got a lot of charm .
don't call me father .
he thinks he is . he says his mother was apache , but i suspect he's lying .
you set me up . for a story . you know what's crazy ? i was actually considering waiting for you .
that's a lie ! listen@@ don't believe what he says . . .

hey , he'll be all right . believe me lana , i know . i was a late bloo@@ mer myself .
i found it on the seat .
it's time you found out . i love you . i love you . you're a beautiful and intelligent woman - - a beautiful and intelligent woman and a great actress - - at the peak of her career . you have every reason for happiness - - every reason , but due to some strange , un@@ con@@ tro@@ llable , unconscious drive you permit the slightest action of a kid - - kid like eve to turn you into a hysterical , screaming har@@ p@@ y ! now once and for all , stop it !
i think you'd better leave now .
he may be .

this isn't possible ...
why would i do that ?
no news yet ?
no ? well - - johnson , you're under arrest . you , too , burns .
if what you're saying is true , then why would he have killed two police officers ? a man like that would want to lay low , if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission !
i don't want you hanging around there , hear ?
what's that ?
he took it like a man . toss him in that dra@@ in@@ age ditch .
this hearing is absurd ! let me tell my story ...

i worked my ass off for my badge , kittle , it's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there .
well , you did invite me here .
i've been trailing the cashier like you told me . you're right about that guy , chief . there's something screwy somewhere .
you know how long i've been begging to take you on the wine tour . i was beginning to think it was never going to happen .
cu@@ th@@ bert's counting on the exhi@@ b@@ iti@@ on's success . the museum is in debt . contributions and public funding have dried up . admissions no longer cover overhead . the last big in@@ fusion of cash we had was the king tut exhibit . cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red . if the superstition exhibit isn't lucrative , he'll have to start au@@ cti@@ oning off some of these gems .
yes ! this is about me . why can't you understand that , you of all people ? it's not the war - - it's nixon ! they want to destroy nixon ! and if i expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out . do you want that ? do you want to see that , buddy ? it's not pretty .
a witness to what ... ?
they switched us over .
how do we locate the creature ?
i called o@@ ha@@ shi , he'll be waiting . i like him waiting .
where's sarah ? where did she go ? she was here ...
bob , how long has wes been working on this script ?
order fromberge to keep him in safety ! it is the least you can do , to protect your own honor !
upstate where ?
no .
that means he probably will kill johnnie .
a hundred .
hi .
well , we better get on with it .
no .
didn't you get my message ?
you will survive this ... donald . i promise you that you will survive . you must let me help you . and when i clap my hands together , you will wake up .
your father ? ?

but how could you say such a thing ?
that is a direct result of anti - blonde di@@ scri@@ min@@ ation !
yeah , i guess .

i was thinking tonight you could go have a look around pal@@ mer's hotel room while i go check out karen flores ' place . see if he hasn't stashed it somewhere .
justin . i won't let you die .
so what ? the pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing . hey , how about a date tonight , rita . let's eat pasta and roll around .
you want to wipe the slate clean as much as i do . okay , so maybe i am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me . you have a purpose though ! remember ? let's face it , the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven .
i told what's his name - - tom - - that i'd meet him .
how is he ?
she's unconscious .
i ain't never met anyone come close to you , sugar .
robbed ?
you , too . kick ass today .
leave me alone .
it's better than freezing to death down below , isn't it ?
we need to stick to the plan . head for the coast .
i want him to think that .
i can't help it . i have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature . call me crazy .
... and that you invited him to strike you ? to fight it out on the deck of your ship ? !
she's a dental hy@@ gi@@ en@@ ist . she'll know what to do .
well , i do .
how come you never got married again ?
bacon , see what we got .
no .
i'm looking for my nephew , thomas .
ebby calvin " nuke " laloosh - -
i used to believe that . now i'm not so sure .
hon ... i didn't want to die , but really , this is fine with me . as long as i never have to wash dishes again .
your work .
lenny , you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures .
for what ?
i got the money to pay for ' em .
don't be an idiot .
now what ?
i had so many things to think about !
you and your side@@ burns are the talk of the party , theo .
why me ?
well , jackie , you got caught , you're gonna have to give ' em something .
goodbye .
i don't think there's any hope , either . i was just trying to make you feel better .
... cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission ... !
oh ! madam is can@@ ce@@ lling the engagement . madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke . ha , ha , ha - - hurry , come on . tonight - - there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock . the house is jammed to the roof .
what ?
i'm here for the same reason you are , so let's do it .
dr . kurtzweil , i'm not interested in bi@@ go@@ ted ideas about race or ge@@ no@@ ci@@ de . i don't believe in the elders of zion , the knights te@@ m@@ pla@@ r , the bi@@ l@@ der@@ burg group or in a one@@ world jew run government - -
mine's new .
the cli@@ pper to america .
what did you see ? what did it look like ?
hell ...
yes ... i guess so . he was sleeping on the front porch when i left .
don't worry . you won't see him again . what happened ? did you change your mind about going ?
wait , i'm just about to tell you the best part .
he's smart , powerful , successful - -
hi , it's really great to meet you guys . i know this sounds weird but once i had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed , but i knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that - -
oooo@@ hhhh .
yes , of course i can swim . how far do you think it is ?
they're pretty . can i have them ?
but i'm surprised you're still working for her , unless she's suddenly come up with another husband .
just a minute , you !
man . thanks . you know when you get a feelin ' and you don't know why ?
is he in pain ?
si@@ kali horse , my lord . christians all i know each one by name .
yeah .
i don't mind .
what ?
you sure that's the reason ?
well , that's the general idea , my dear .
yes you are . a guy . guy . quite a guy . oh my . look at that@@ --i r@@ hy@@ med . yikes . bikes !
don't you ever stop talking ?
things change . hey , good to meet you . we'll be working hand in glove in go@@ tha@@ m's glorious future .
reading the patient's vital signs .
john ...
oh jack , mi@@ ght@@ n't i touch one ? it would thrill me so .
so that's it .
aunt barbara . i'll try not to get depressed .
to make a statement . i'm gonna give them the name . maybe the jack@@ als can help us out for once .
you're a hell of a flyer . you can be my win@@ g@@ man any time .
if i find anything i'll call you .
are we leaving ?
i'd show him my hearse . and my room , and stuff .
chet ? to a play ? are you kidding ?
someone's following me .
it's weird . i actually feel good about myself . can we do this again next week ?
ah , doctors . what's he gonna tell me ? can't trade my head in for a new one .
don't run away - i was always the man for you ! i'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what i say ! inside of six months -
no arbogast . no bates . and only the old lady at home ... a sick old lady unable to answer the door ... or unwilling .
i remember you .
a proper ab@@ ori@@ g@@ ine .
super ... man . hmmm ...
you know what i think ? i think you only want me now , because i'm with somebody else .
please don't follow me . don't do it !
you felt sad . what's your name ?
how long ago was it ?
i hope i helped you out .
it's a hellhole . three motels and a man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in factory . my dad worked there for thirty-five years .
so , you live around here .
you could say that .
do you have another tie ? something more conservative ?
i am better .
it pays to know your way around , oliver .
as you did at fort wilderness ?
that's okay , i wanted to .
i'm surprised you never found out about it , dante . everybody in school k@@ new@@ -@@ even in my class .
i was leaving .
you're crazy ! you can't do that !
... i have to stand up for her ...
agent kulok and i were in o'@@ hare when we heard .
what ?
it's an art book .
of course not !
this is it , lady . last stop .
is it not a pleasure , gentlemen , for me , as i am drawing near the goal , to find my home such a happy one ; my wife so fond of me , that she is even now thinking of a@@ p@@ po@@ in@@ ting a successor ? isn't it a comfort to see her ; like a prudent housewife , getting everything ready for her husband's departure ?
come on , everybody ! let's go !
it's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much i hate his guts .
you pull a muscle or something ?
no . we live simply , mr . jimmy and i . people come to play bridge . and now and then , young men to swim . you have people , boone ?
anything interesting .
how about the " hell mer@@ chan@@ ts " ?
i know you will .
nobody's there . it's four o'clock on a saturday . how many people ever come to the store at four on a saturday ?
no , fish is a pm food .
you mind if we get out of this guy's brain first ?
no . i'll try again later .
let me see .
where'd you get this ?
you didn't step on any mine .
evan , guess what ? dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie .
hurry ! queen cher@@ lin@@ d@@ re@@ a will know what to do .
no - -
no , you're not . go ahead and take your time .
all right , i'll tell them . they're right here in front .
you better put on the lights . i can't see what i'm doing .
is he really that big a sap ?
how's your her@@ ni@@ a ?
it doesn't matter . it's too late for all of us .
vice ... jesus .
yeah , , it goes up a little and then it goes down , maybe nixon will do something . what's the difference , they're all a bunch of jerks . i wouldn't let ' em run my business , i can tell you that much . not if i had any choice in the matter . i don't know what to do with you . i don't know , i don't know what's right or wrong anymore .
i'm so hungry .
what ?
mr . scru@@ g@@ gs , jeff wigand . lowell bergman said i should give you a call ...
fine .
you came here to give me my report card ?
that's going on optimism .
wrong cabinet .
a@@ h-@@ hh , no .
you certainly do .
all right . the truth ?
you're learning a cruel lesson .
go for it , man .
this would be a bad time for me to leave .
you left your back wide open . freeze could have killed you .
the name's plissken .
nah . it's a scratch .
yeah , sure , i guess .
and did you witness the shoot-out ?
mmm@@ n@@ kay .
the po@@ in@@ ters were great . i'll study the tape .
jesus , she's my best friend .
oooh , i see . didn't go so good last night , huh ? that's a sho@@ cker . you mean getting drunk and calling victoria didn't put you in the mood ? you dumb fuck . your divorce pain@@ 's getting real old real fast , dude .
have i ?
i'm not that good .
dela , kiss my big black ass .
don't wait e@@ for me .
it's serious ?
it won't even hold the one day , ronnie - -
it got to you , didn't it . all the killing in the war . you need it now .
let me tell you something . listen to me .
you don't think of me that way , do you ?
when'd you quit smoking ?
did i get you up ?
soon , dark eyes , soon .
i think i'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave . just might be his first broken heart .
bad is bad , buddy . there ain't no sense to it .
mary robert , don't panic . remember what we talked about ? experience ?
why don't you go on . we'll meet you at the clearance desk in a few minutes .
how's your brother ?
she's right over there .
yes . my husband has been very ill . his doctor and nurses are staying with us . those hospitals can be so impersonal - why , it might be hours before you are treated ...
station !
what's the difference ?
i bet you did .
uh , you wanna hunt outta season , it's cool with me . but mostly , well , they just take a six ...
are they indeed ? thank you .
don't shoot ! i've done what i can for you . i'm sorry it's not better , but i've got my own problems . i've already stuck my neck out further than i should ...
yes , sir , but i can get him ...
but but you're married . you have kids a great wife .
what do we do ? get some help ? radio in ?
what's wrong , did you miss me ?
a son , yeah . what about him ? joey .
you mean that guy was an agent ?
why not ?
listen to me , it's over .
and i'm here tonight and i won't let him get to you .
oh , yes , i am , because <u> afterwards </u> - - up here in the moonlight .
i have some errands to run , and then i thought we'd spend the evening ...
they're going to kill me next . that's what i hear . these new indians are destroying everything . our people are a quiet people .
i think there's an angle .
yes - - i mean - - you never get anyone in ' wings of a dove ' having the nerve to say ' inform the pentagon that we need black star cover . '
you may not realize it , but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail . every single move we make , from the m@@ und@@ an@@ e to the monumental ... the red light we stop at , or run ; the people we have sex with , or won't with us ; the airplane we ride , or walk out of ... is all a part of death's sadistic design leading to the grave .
washington is full of corn@@ p@@ one country pussy - - just ask jesse jackson .
makes you cry
was i at that dinner ?
two vehicles . they're not supposed to be here .
for us .
i've also been thinking about the team . responsibilities , who should cover what - -
she's fine . you really think i'd be a good investment ?
w-w-@@ what has that got to do with this maiden ?
shut up !
wake up ? !
i guess i had it coming . let's call it settled .
fine , then let's get started . the current state of our country is of vital interest to us all , and i would like to know if you agree with the president's view of the economy ?
how's david ?
you can't - - ! you mustn't - - ! i've all the demons of hell in my head ; my only salvation is to vent them on paper - -
maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo . we heard some explosions out there this morning ...
i appreciate your concern , number one , but i've been itching to try out the argo .
well , we ...
no - - gene kelly . remember the way he danced down there next to the river in ' american in paris ' - - without a care in the world ? this is good , want some ?
start at the beginning . page one , the first one . here - -
you should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it . you forgot or what ? you could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine , plus two years in prison . now you want to talk to us about it , or you want to talk to customs ?
the shooter knew these guys , huh ?
i guessed you were straight black .
viktor , i'm so happy for us !
when ?
karen ? you okay ?
what a question ... because i want to be with you , naturally . i hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days ... isn't this water wonderful !
he is a mercenary ! did he not already try to convince the king of por@@ tu@@ gal of his absurd notions ?
i'm telling you right now , i'm fine . i lost my goddamn balance and i couldn't see a moment , but i'm ok .
yeah , you do that , lenny .
yes , there is . i'd like to go up .
the poet ... something he said ...
that's pretty weird . is it possible for someone to not sleep for months ?
oh , thank you . thank you !
don't do this
oh . well , i'd love to hear some .
i'll need an office on the grounds ; someplace to store my things .
it's only a ring . not a collar .
stop ! ! !
right as rain .
oh yes , of course .
why would you do such a thing ?
whatever gave you that idea ?
i'm alone on this ...
wait a minute . my birthright is in the graveyard ? later not .
don't throw that away . i had that once with a guy . but i threw it away for a cheap thrill .
but they are not yet one of us .
you know the thing i love about mu@@ stan@@ gs ? the steering wheel .
i've got ' em ! they're back on my screens !
takes diamonds to stay on this list .
this guy's only half cooked . there's no time to fuck around , stan .
we don't need guns .
look at his face , he did the deed .
what it is - - is the truth .
i don't follow your logic . what does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting ordell's money ?
you say , john , cut our losses and all the rest . but suppose the thing blows and they indict bob and the others . jesus , you'd never recover from that , john . it's better to fight it out instead , and not let people testify ...
i need to sit down a minute .
no brea@@ ch@@ -of-@@ promise case has been filed . the matter has been settled out of court .
you know , it's not always easy for me , either . but at least i try not to give in to each and every neurosis .
it's important .
i know what you went through tonight . i kept thinking of what you said : that all good things died here , violently .
how nice . how do you do , senator ?
shopping , really ? i should tell my friend .
most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit ... play with the lev@@ ers and things . maverick well , get used to it .
look at me , ray .
my office is on the third floor ! there's a walk-in safe and a portable phone ! we can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help !
i thought they locked you in your room .
do you want to go somewhere and talk ?
no .
ask for trouble and you get it . why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years . then he refused to marry her . why ? - - because she only scored sixty-@@ one on a look magazine marriage quiz !
where's sartorius ?
nothing . do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one ?
look , reese , i didn't ask for this honor and i don't want it . any of it .
in new york ?
do you still talk to sylvan ?
oh , wait a minute , now i see where you're going .
hey - - what's he like ?
he only weighs ten ounces - -
totally - - you were being very , very bad . you went up in the plane and jumped out . you had a parachute , but it didn't open .
but a good strange .
you all right ?
i used to think he was something , once ... i was eighteen , i didn't know any better , and he had something steady to offer .
thank you so much , my friend . i will get in touch with you .
they tell me you use narcotics . could i bring someone around to look at your arms ?
so does elliot .
don't ! let him have all the privacy he wants . let him grieve , let him rage . there has never been a funeral for his father .
tom , i love you ! see ! i bought it for him , for his birthday .
i have been ... afraid . afraid ... they will hate me ... because i am so very ugly ... and they are so very beautiful
ohh !
who you run loads for ? cause other than nicholas , you knows you ?
maybe it would be a good idea if you just took michael .
this is crazy .
carolyn showed me where she hid him , hid him with all the ones he killed - -
you've been watching the film .
not yet . don't say anything yet . okay ?
i say we don't call it in . under no circumstance are we to call this in .
so nice
just open the door , please .
i'm okay .
well , it's not a short one .
yeah . maybe he'll call .
beautiful but dangerous . once you see it tainted with blood , its beauty is hard to admire . it's 400 years old .
you're in pain .
oh , i had the radio on .
good luck .
fuck you , you fat fuck .
she was a delta gamma ! not in my pledge class or anything - - she graduated five years ahead of me . but i used to take her class at the la sports club . she's amazing !
just wonderin ' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum .
yes - - oh !
i was special . the only colored kid in class . i became a sort of mascot . like a pink poodle .
you are the blacksmith . ever sh@@ od a horse with a ho@@ of this large ?
so , you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel ? knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere ?
yah , it's this vehicle i asked you about yesterday . i was just wondering -
you and cy have a nice talk ? he tell you about sunrise enterprises , helping people ? well , i've seen him hurt people . why are you following me ?
hi .
why did you change your name ?
but you like him .
well , well , well .
you know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself ?
of course . and two is the prince who k@@ ne@@ els before her on one knee .
you know what i think ?
can we go fly over central park ?
and my compliments to you ...
we're partners , aren't we ?
the americans themselves have made it possible . we will anni@@ hi@@ late them in a single attack - - at pearl harbor .
can i undress and talk at the same time ?
lingerie is my life , sir . my mother's got a shop in brooklyn , i grew up in it , from the time i could crawl , we carry caen lingerie , it's the best there is , it's all i been thinking about since the invasion .
he's imbecile , no doubt from birth . he speaks , but ... it's all gibberish . no , the man's a homeless idiot ... i pray god he's an idiot .
the president and i were delighted that we could accommodate you . now if you're all cleared ? you can follow me then .
i'd say there's about , oh , fifty thousand dollars here . what would you say ray ?
- - breaker , breaker . this is banana peel .
what's his real name ?
' you're sorry and i'm sorry . '
am i ... disturbing you ?
because of the future . i know what's going to happen .
she the one from santa cruz ?
no .
eyes blood@@ shot . must have been staring out the window for hours .
you can tell me all about it - - from your prison cell .
you know who i am ?
i'm not going to hurt you .
think this old guy is her boyfriend ? it's the only picture she carries .
you're losing me .
i own a brown@@ stone on this block .
no ... i don't ...
we're gonna try .
no , thanks . i'll take the bus .
that's just what they used to say in the ads . come on , crabtree , i know you're holding ...
indeed it is . during the day , visitors prefer to be outside , au na@@ tu@@ rel . as it were .
with what ?
somebody's gone tropical on us , baby . tropical !
yes , i would like to see ben .
what about the other two ?
we got worried . there we were waiting and drinking away at the old kni@@ fy mo@@ lo@@ ko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other , so around we come to your abo@@ de .
you ever fuck a jewish girl ?
you're sitting on your ticket .
that's the only way you can cope with the route your life has taken . the fact that you made the choice to pursue this life - style ... much to the cha@@ gr@@ in of your mother ... who is so clearly ashamed of you . imagine her shame when we cart you off to prison because you won't just tell the truth about what really happened . <b> ext . nevada desert - - day for night [ mescaline trip ]
football in college .
is that so ? you might marry me ?
can too .
thanks . you think this whole business is silly , don't you ? i mean running away and everything .
but they caught the guy . i heard it all . sounded like he just went berserk , fucking loco . shooting anybody . drugs , probably .
nothing . i dropped the soap . that's all .
" yo soy un ho@@ mb@@ re sin@@ cer@@ o ... " i am a sincere man , from the land of the palms ...
... or bu@@ lli@@ ed or what ever you're doing . who the hell do you think you are ? you go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child .
i think maybe we're missing the point . it seems to me james ' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand . he treats us like adults . he respects us enough to forget us . that takes ... courage .
you can't go . you can't be anywhere near that place .
you sure about this fa@@ a announcement ?
honey - - i can't find those large - size hefty trash bags !
they shouldn't have come without calling first .
she's nosy . she hears me on the telephone .
no , my friends are right here !
what do you mean ?
you know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman , don't ya ? you know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell ?
no . i'm doing fine ... look .
they don't know that . we were the only one's on deck . look , there's nothing they can do to me right ? i'm a kid .
what do you think of me ?
yes , but this is not a ballet . this is a dance at fi@@ ga@@ ro@@ 's wedding .
seconds . three , four .
damn . she sure goes out of her way .
remember slamming the cab door in my face and .. you know , it came very dangerously close to e@@ ma@@ scu@@ lating my nose in a ...
picking on me won't help .
we don't .
gee - - that fair - -
what ?
utah is not exactly a cure for boredom .
she's nobody . she likes me .
wade .
mr rothstein is being very typical to this point .
yeah , but the vehicles you were borrowing on , i just can't read the serial numbers on your application . maybe if you could just read them to me -
in the navy , we used to call guys - -
nothing ?
wouldn't it be just the same , darling , if daddy dropped the present at mrs . far@@ ren@@ 's on his way to town tomorrow morning ?
yes .
alex , what are you doing ?
yeah . no more . i'm finished with that sh@@ ite .
then if emma turns me down will you marry me ?
yes , i'm afraid i have .
kid , you ever been in a high speed chase before ?
oh no , i don't think that would be a good idea .
this is not a good way to start a relationship , stickin ' a gun to a man's head , feelin ' around his personal equipment . make him think you don't trust him .
too risky . we don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car .
the wise snake co@@ ils before he strikes .
and what is that ?
enough for a test .
and you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun . if leons austrian was looking for you i reckon hed have found you before i did .
jack .
gross ! you must remember to tell me this in the morning . i'm , like , so freaked out now .
we're being attacked ! kill ! kill ! kill !
very fucking funny . where's what i want ?
it was fort su@@ m@@ ter they fired on -
" how would you like to have the story , you big tub of@@ of "
if you start in on the war metaphors i'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole .
oh my god , you scared the shit out of me . you following me again ?
julia .
i don't know how i can get you out of it this time . how will it end ? what will happen to you ?
you going to come talk to me or not ?
i want to ask a favor , boys . one day , when i'm long gone and all but forgotten , make one last toast to abe henry . and remember me as a friend .
she understands .
for emphasis ?
fine .
i can't be honest with them .
your soldier .
we kidnapped noriega out of panama . is that covered in your constitution ? because it isn't in mine .
no .
the professors ? yeah , they tend to do that . so@@ cra@@ tic method .
before ? where ? where had you been ?
what do you mean ?
i'm sorry ?
night after that ?
of course , elaine . but as long as there's any question , better johnny should come back and clear his name .
i need to talk to you .
i did that on purpose . i don't have to miss .
i don't know .
is that all ?
we don't have to put ourselves through this again , dick .
if you do get out of your marriage , will you continue to be in@@ hi@@ b@@ it@@ ed ?
thank you , thank you , thank you ! i'll do that for you some time . that's very sweet . say listen , what did you say your name was ?
damn ... damn ... damn ...
come on , trapper . we got to forget golf for today .
lemme guess . would that be where the memories are stored ?
thank you very much .
you can read it , if you want to . you want to go out for a while ? to a movie ?
but -
well , that all depends .
i think it's a fucking good idea .
you'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom .
yes , yes , i know that . everybody does . lord le@@ on@@ de@@ gran@@ ce is my only ally among the barons and the great knights . i can't lose him .
i got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me .
shhh . it's okay . just breathe . i'll fix it ...
good to know you , john .
i think it may help us but theres a slight chance it could make things worse .
guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy .
do you have a minute - - ?
impossible !
i don't like talking bad about the dead , but now that he's gone i can tell you she put up with things in that marriage i wouldn't have . and yes , she , of all people , was the one who defended him . and that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry .
get in there !
what if it isn't over ?
you were at leavenworth , huh ?
why ?
wait .
ma'am , i'm as gentle as a puppy dog . why , i haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks ! hi ya , doc !
what is wrong with you ?
no .
i wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or - -

in the other man's re@@ ct@@ um .
the only other thing i can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out .
so we have two choices . either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and i don't know anybody that thirsty or ... ... he <i> is </i> here . we test again . you're right , hugo , this was a desperate act . someone had a lot to lose that night@@ --@@ perhaps their place in line . i'd like the pro@@ files of everyone with an up@@ coming mission .

it doesn't seem possible , but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
what do you mean , and be bored to death ?
the very fact that they're authorities should give you reason . people will do anything to protect their own interests . for all you know he was killed at the <u> hands </u> of the police .
i thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night !
no . not yet ...
we leave it where it is . stick to the plan .
my man ? you told wyatt you'd dis@@ armed those men . do you actually believe after that i could see you as my man ? you're just a dirty little fix@@ er .
low overhead , m'@@ boy . we pass the savings on to you . but seriously , that's all covered in orientation .

pendergast told me the killer ex@@ tra@@ cts and eats the hypothalamus and tha@@ la@@ mus of the victim's brains !

i kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together , on the same night . it'll be a lot less scary . you have to go .
no . sara , you don't understand ...
i was fooling , silly . you need a cigarette , because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book , and you just have one , and the match is to light it . and you need one glass of champagne . dome pear@@ -@@ ig@@ g-@@ non .
it's a shame he wasn't more headstrong .

this ? temporary . to pay the bills and save . i got plans ...
sybok - this is not the god of sha ka ree - or any other god !
and that's exactly what i'm talkin ' ' bout .
who's the deputy director of the f . b . i . ?
where are my goddamn books ?
i still have your virginity !
i remember when you was a little girl marie . you come back from the movies and you'd say - mama that ending was so sad ... and i'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in hollywood . and you believed me .
you know the jedi master ?
i bet you can .
no , i'm fascinated .
fancy a ni@@ bble ?
deodorant .
no shark fin , no camel hump . what you listenin ' to ?

moore ?
of course . how much ?
you didn't kill anybody . stop .
what i meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you .
some comm@@ it@@ te@@ e's got it .

i'll hide .
i know . i'm sorry .

what is your idea of being a jew ?
it doesn't matter where you sit !
well , you're sweet , but you don't really love me .
me again . hi . listen ga@@ d@@ da@@ fi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything . when you speak to him he's not at all nuts . he seems like a leader - - very impressive , self-@@ control ... that's what's so strange .
we don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed . besides ... you've already impressed everyone you need to , haven't you ?
you hear that ? you can drink as much as you want up here .
how soon ?
was there a shark ? did you see a shark ?
don't be afraid of him none . i don't care what he does to you , we can still be together .
i wanted to tell you alone ; your wife doesn't know what's going on .
but you know , i should really be the one going .
don't be a fool ! he's carson dyle !
if jack won't come with us , we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves . that's all there is to it .
the indians have no such word , don mo@@ xi@@ ca .
ya hope i don't keep acting like a whore or i'll turn into one , right ?
yes sir .
how long have you been back ?
years ago , if memory serves . when does the exhibit end ?
why did you do this ?
fleet encourages marriages among flight officers . you'd probably get a promotion out of it .
it's called the indian walk . walkin ' without makin ' a sound .
comment , say things , think . whatever . why are you so special ?
what ?
this spells trouble .
well , lemme play the other side then .
don't hate me , trinity . i'm just the messenger . and right now i'm going to prove it to you .
she says , throw the piano overboard .

now , children , no fighting - - save that for the office . let's have our dance .
on her knees , i have no doubt ! very touching , very acade@@ my-@@ of-@@ dramatic arts !
didn't i just say that ? fucking listen . anyway , i did it all for carolyn . he never appreciated her , but i worshipped that woman and still she rejected me . so , i came back for you . just like i did for carolyn .
okay .
i don't know .
happy birthday , darling . ...
i'm in here .
yeah .
i'm no stranger to the notion of phi@@ lan@@ thro@@ p@@ y . andrew carnegie has long been one of my i@@ do@@ ls .
someday , dick .
i didn't intend to sleep all night ! i just pulled over ... have i broken any laws ?
no it's not .

excuse me , i hope this isn't rude , but aren't you marion da@@ vi@@ es ?
we've come a long way since homecoming .
of course . i'm aware of the geneva convention . they will be given the burial they deserve . or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the eastern front and give them a twenty-one gun salute ?
yeah , couple a mu@@ skies . no pike yet . how d'you feel ?
well what is it ? i'm not k@@ re@@ skin .
arbogast said ...

boone ! you awake ? eight o'clock .
look , i didn't mean to hurt anybody ... god , i didn't mean to ... to ...
i got family . ... please .
give us a chance , dad !
i think she's a honey . look at those ju@@ gs .
but maybe just for awhile - -
then leave it in the past . old flames are like old tax returns . you keep ` em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut ` em loose .
we might need some mo ' money behind this .
damn , that's a long drive .
you see ? thea believes it , too !
you ready for this ? i've recently discovered that our good friend mrs . caldwell is the one who sent the letter to annette ur@@ ging her to stay away from me .
their arms ?
what ?
nah , why should you ?
yeah .
you can talk to julia . forget the radio .
i didn't expect that he would .
i ... given the limits of your question , that's correct .
i don't know . possibly .
what's this , what's this ? !
you don't get it , do you ?
why ?
i'll get you out ! just be quiet so i can hear . shut that dog up . is there a ladder ? is there a rope ?
who did he leave with ?
for what ? he left . not me .
but ' tis no wit to go .
are you serious ?
but that's what happened before .
you can't just break into lan@@ g@@ don car@@ michael's house . this man has done nothing .
explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains ...
how else do you get seaweed under your nails ?
okay , listen - -
delly , shhhhhh ...
objection .
oh ... kinda the same way .
i don't know .
talks all day , too ! how the hell can you put up with her , john ?
now let's get down to business . kuato wants what's in qua@@ id's head . and he might be able to get it , cause they say he's psychic . now i have a little plan to keep this from happening . - - do you think you can play along ?
i don't . but i got confidence in findley .
what ?
stupid woman ... and that's all ?
john , may i introduce you to sir carr gomm .
believe me , i've done everything possible short of asking agnes .
okay , that's very easy . five , six years from now i'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations .
that's right - - one with high yield , rich assets and no down@@ side ...
rats ?
sir , yes , sir !
frankie ... do you respect me ? do i have your loyalty ?
i missed you , fran .
no , thank you . i have my car .
i got it ta my head now . i got it ta my head now .
that was with edward . she's accustomed to his world . star@@ gh@@ er's mind is un@@ familiar territory . she's " lost . " someone has to go in . remind her what's really happening . and get her out . until then , she's at his mercy .
you know , even when i think about your face i get happier .
i have so got brains .
you've only known jake a few months .
what'd you do ! just pick my number out of the air ?
with your hands or your tongue ?
you always over@@ react , clark . how terrible can it be ?
well , there it is , isn't it ? you don't even like them , and you'd sleep with them . what's that all about ?
morning ! who's that little old man ?
saw you in the street outside . you seemed interesting . is this where you live ?
get out of my way .
when does he graduate high school ?
not for us ?
then i envy yo .
what are you going to do ? - charlie ?
you're talking like a drunk .
the thought i'm tryin ' to get over is you grew up beau@@ te@@ e@@ ful . remember me ?
don't bother
oh , no - you don't want to go yet , honey . she'll stick around too . is that right ?
< < it was smaller than that . sharper . > >
he's trying to be an actor .
i told you already : jennifer jenzen , executive v . p . of - -
what's gonna go wrong ? ! i take your place for the royal inspection . bala comes strolling down the line , she sees me - - <u> bingo </u> ! love is re@@ kin@@ d@@ led , and she takes me up to the palace for a little ... tea and cru@@ m@@ pe@@ ts ... and you take your place again , and go march around to your heart's content !
thank you .

' k-@@ k-@@ kay , mack !
i clocked him this morning . he was running like a doll .
i said , skip it , michael . it's my treatment .
look ... i'm getting a bad feeling up here ... i'd like you to do something for me . look up my wife ... don't ask how , you'll know by then ... and tell her ... tell her ... i've been a jerk . when things pan@@ ned out for her , i should've been behind her all the way ... we had something great going until i screwed it up ... she was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me . she's heard me say i love you a thousand times , but she never got to hear this ... honey ... i'm sorry . you get all that ?
what did you think ?
just ... just wanted to say hello ...
... lover's lane ?
what is this ?
you insist on calling all the shots . and by the way : i am not a helpless girl .
alright ... i changed my mind . i'll have a mar@@ gar@@ ita with and a shot of cuervo on the side , please .
which one are you ?
i dunno about this ... what will my mother think ?
sa@@ lo@@ me - - what a woman ! what a part ! the princess in love with a holy man . she dances the dance of the seven ve@@ ils . he re@@ je@@ cts her , so she demands his head on a golden tray , kissing his cold , dead lips .
don't fuck around . you're gonna get us all killed .
gaston would never tell me . it was a@@ subject not to be spoken of , captain .
i know where to look .
yeah .
i got it . thank you .
just had one .
yeah , he said for you to give us a lift into town . you're the ones with the stu@@ de@@ baker , aren't you ?
when you jumped in the bay , you didn't know where you were . you guessed but you didn't know .
you couldn't say .
obviously , this can't last . she's going to dump him . viktor won't be able to take that . he's too sensitive . it'll destroy him .
we'll get you cleaned up , find a suitable gown ... i imagine you'll enjoy a good meal ?
got you !
i'm just waiting and seeing . like you said .
is this dangerous or anything ?
haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before ?
we find the man and then we dissect him -
i miss murray , harry .
i'm replacing lazarro . nice , safe desk job - - just like you wanted .
thank you . i bought it especially , mrs . rieper .
go on , tell him . tell the truth . tell him how you feel , shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child , who was once the same age as this boy . somebody's flesh who was innocent once .
yeah .
i'd take him to the doctor .
in science , the letter of fact is the letter of law . our pursuit is as dog@@ matic as any religious pre@@ cept . think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and ha@@ l@@ lo@@ wed se@@ ct . someday you may be priests ... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse . any questions ?
no . i saw her with tod .
bobby , rhymes with hobby .
dwayne ... it is imperative that we keep this confidential . now we know someone's out there . very close . it may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner .
a@@ ve@@ c a tu pour@@ ra@@ s le supporter .
yeah . convert it into lo@@ f@@ ts . ok . pop quiz . what's the single most important aspect of your job ?
dick ? dick who ?
you murdered gino !
you mean the men@@ ac@@ ing red car ?
they're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe .
sol@@ da@@ do .
but everybody is all right .
and we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married !
get the body of our army up to green@@ e's van@@ guard as fast as we can . all the damned fool has to do is hit the british rea@@ r@@ guard and then hold for us .
don't eat all those sweets . you'll get sick .
what ? the end of the world ? man , don't give me your mad rap . i'm not a bartender . i don't want to hear it . i raise a family doing this bullshit . do me a favor . get your crazy white ass out of my chair .
can i put my hand inside your night@@ gown , rose ?
okay . now we're going to buy you some clothes .
you must listen carefully : the fire department will be here soon . there is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance . as shelly webster once needed your assistance , and as you are shortly going to need my assistance .
i'll get her . have a good christmas , matt ...
pro , the sun's out !
i'll make it up to you , i promise .
are you sure ?
bye-bye , elena . ... what an idiot ! what an idiot ! ' nice day ' ! christ ! !
yeah , that's tough ! you don't deserve cole porter . you should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother !
scene 32 . int . can@@ dy's living room - night . " what are you talking about ricky , the murders were a completely isolated incident " .
i'm working on a sketch . that old garage of yours is so rundown , it's kind of interesting .
she must really be something . from a clinical point of view .
sure , i'll take a chance .
the two of us were the only deputies back then me and bu@@ dd@@ y--@@ it's what - - ' 58 - -
what you want ?
i'm a law suit .
you could say we represent the <u> un </u> official view of a well-@@ ordered society .
yes . he assumed hank was your husband . he didn't know .
you did create me in your image , nathan . before you i was a simple , happy , complete being , in harmony with the world around me . after you i became du@@ pli@@ cit@@ ous , cynical , angry , anal , totally out of touch with my surroundings . in a word , nathan , i became you . lila has re@@ introduced me to myself . and , incidentally , what i'm about to do , kill you , is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the earth . before when i killed , it was for food or in self-defense . now i will kill for revenge . revenge is an abstract concept , nathan . and i learned abstract thinking from you .
yeah . sure . why not . call me at the regent beverly wilshire .
well , i'm sorry honey -
when you do , let me in on it .
big see ! i don't want one for one night . i want something for a thousand and one nights , with plenty of room for la@@ be@@ ls from italy and ba@@ gh@@ dad , sa@@ mark@@ and . . . a great big one .
okay , it was me . what'd i do now ?
your weapons , sergeant .
what would you have me say , david ?
... but you're not - - you're not sure ...
no . i have children , grandchildren too . i visit when i can . but now that mr . jimmy cannot be left very long , i do not get away much . poor mr . jimmy . there is much good in him , but he will suffer the fires of hell . very sad .
take it easy . what's goin ' on anyway ? . why are you in so much trouble ?
not exactly . it has organic qualities , but we don't really understand how they're inte@@ gra@@ ted with the mechanical systems .
what do you mean ?
long story . i found this key in the mouth of a wooden har@@ le@@ qu@@ in .
he is the great one ...
don't you watch television ? don't you listen to the radio ?
you want to read it ?
inside .
but how can it change every time ?
yes . but they don't have a clue . why would anyone steal my luggage ?
give me the goddamn page ! !
i'm leaving . you never have to see me again . just please , give me the ticket !
i was on threshold of great things .
i found lisa henderson .
trust me ... you don't want to see any more .
my lady ' 11 come in in about five minutes . have some food sent up in half an hour .
i don't know .
that's the train with all the lights .
sa@@ y-@@ the-@@ god@@ dam@@ n-@@ words : you're gonna be okay !
define illegal .
yeah , we had them cou@@ ri@@ ered over . and listen , good work . they're a great start . we're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research .
send fe@@ ed-@@ back into the control sensors in that detention block .
this is our colorado lounge .
what do you mean ?
so do i .
tell me you checked the bus before we left , carl .
uh , what do i call you ?
you okay ?
do you see a man ?
share the love , tits !
what was that for ?
well , i'm sure it's not christmas , because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other ... i know it's not new years , because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance ... and i'm sure it's not our anniversary , because i didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says , ' pick out something pretty ' ... yes - - maurice - - i'm virtually certain it's not a special day today .
gotta sneeze .
would you like to be modified ?
no .
lunch hour . my next class isn't till nine-thirty .
skipper , you can't do this !
because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money .
so ... what did you think of the tape .
you're like this big bear with claws and fangs ...
well , at least he's polite . tony show him the shirts , adrian .
" but we'll be the same as we started ...
that's not proven , 655321 . in fact , it is only in the experimental stage at this moment .
thank you , no .
how much did you have ?
as a matter of fa@@ ct@@ --i am home .
i'll do it . don't hurt my camera !
mop rags - - mop rags - - we're interested in something quite different !

you have no right to call yourself a bowler . buzz sla@@ ps theo in the face .
i understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show . how did you convince him--@@ was it the opportunity to be close to truman again ?
it was . it is . but this is a different kind of show .
fine . just fine .
no , it's not that , it's ...
tea would be nice .
i'll be here .
hm ?
thats easy . youve seen my car .
ali@@ son's .

what's it like ?
oh . yeah . they ... make me take this stuff ...
wait a minute , joe . use your bean . i couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn , like that . i'd be crazy . there isn't a newspaper in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ 'd give me a job after that ! i could go to jail !
of course it counts . how do you play ?
i * don't * think that's the thing to do ! no ! i think what you ought to do is - - * fight * !
the maintenance ha@@ tch@@ --it takes us outside the building !
i don't know .
you don't have to apologize for me ! i'm sorry if i hurt your feelings . it's just my way of talkin ' ...
ready , uncle lex ?
even so , you're allowed to boast . you look thin by the way , i've mentally undressed you , i can see your ri@@ b@@ cage .
it has to be by the end of this week .
bread ?
i won't even discuss it .

yeah ?
he was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in new england and the construction business .

i don't think you trust anybody , do you ?
of course . are there others , mr . worley ?
yes .
i'm sorry . what will you do ?
guess ! guess , majesty . imagine the longest time such a thing could last , then double it .
you mean , am i gonna help you kill them cowboys ?
no . you will not run me out . no one will believe a word of what you say .
this is ridiculous ...
i tell you , we're going west , and shanghai is east of here !

i'm sorry . they live here , too ?
come on down , guys . it's time for games ! we've got prizes !

well i hope the carpet matches the drapes .
another jolly nickname ?
thank you billy , from the baby and me .

and you should know , if i remember rightly .
i'm afraid not - - i usually do just what i feel like doing at the moment .
you're not telling me something .
what do you want to call me at the office for ?
what chip ?
it is quite late enough .
not to me ! i wasn't fucking married to her !
that's not correct .
make your mind up .

the first rule of project - -
flying to cambodia .
of course there is , jack . what do you think the crusades were - a frat initiation ? i don't think so ... there has to be a grail .
every woman at some point has to date a musician . i wish you'd get rid of mark for good . every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out .

i'm coming over to your side , that's what . and i have a feeling i'm making a big mistake .
but you said you wanted to help - - don't you see what it would mean ?

of merlin ?
nobody in this town really understands junior . when i went to family sessions for him i realized he was the san@@ est one in the family . actually , he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants .
the idea is simply this - that i want those people to leave here immediately .
i won't even dignify that with a response .
and i can go free ?
there is no one .
no , i'm just a friend . what are you doing here , i mean ... you know claudia ?

you have a very good mind , or i wouldn't have come back . that mind is now asking itself , c@@ l@@ ever@@ ly and fairly , " is harold ryan really a clown ? " and the answer is , " yes . "

he was a merchant marine ! he was a respectable man who obe@@ yed the law , and followed the rules - -
soap is called soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any un@@ law@@ ful behaviour . he is proud of his job , and even more proud that it's legal .
i'll heal .
heh , what a hypocrite .
better let us in on it , mollie .
no doubt you would , baron . but do you know , i'm quite indispensable to her . i'm her ballet master and her nurse . i hardly belong to myself anymore . but , there you are , it's grusinskaya - - you can't help adoring her .

this is my grandson , sunny . he is my youngest son's child .
well , it's worth it , really ? i mean , how much longer do you think you need to work with pilgrim ?
indeed . just a moment - as a matter of fact i think i do know someone who could commission a work from him . a very appropriate person to do so . yes .
a double guard's been thrown around the jail , municipal buildings , railroad termin@@ als , and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radi@@ cals at the hour of execution .
too easy . there's gotta be something else in there , another cap maybe .
describe him .

come early . the view is so romantic from my balcony .
i see . what do you think our alternatives are ?
a friend . we were va@@ ca@@ tion@@ ing . eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs , so ben found a guy who would take them para@@ sailing . they never came back .
aramis , porthos and athos too . i know what they have done was a threat against you - - and yet that threat has been removed , with no harm coming to your majesty . if their pa@@ ssi@@ ons were in error , their spirits have ever been noble . forgive them .
what ?
captain nor@@ rin@@ g@@ ton ... i appreciate your fer@@ v@@ or , but i am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter .
and if i enclosed it ?
i know what you're thinking . but the truth is , this other person is not someone i'm in love with . as a matter of fact , after what she just did , she's not even someone i like much . so in a technical sense , i'm not sure you could call me and her cheating ... officially .
easy , tiger . come by after school . i'll leave darryl with the sitter .
this whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-@@ willies .
almost two days .

farley is already a tv winner as we shall see . den@@ ton@@ vile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene .
you were expecting me ?
a undercover cop has got to be marlon bran@@ do . to do this job you got to be a great actor . you got to be natura@@ li@@ stic . you got to be natura@@ li@@ stic as hell . if you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor , and bad acting is bullshit in this job .
i realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking , but killing yourself so you can be with william shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions . you're ven@@ tur@@ ing far past daytime talk show fo@@ dder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy .
they're yours . take them .

two d - 6 ' s . that's the kind his well was fitted for .
no . wait . what ? why ? i didn't mean it . you gotta sit down . you can still give me the dirty look ... just sit down and give it to me .
i'm sorry , i don't recall - -
things are kind of confusing .
they blame me for everything . her , tod , the plane crash ...
but you won't get that splatter effect .
good luck . it's not there anymore .
no thanks , i'll do it . give yourself twenty dollars . under@@ hill .

not yet . but we'll find him .
how embarrassing . did i hold up three fingers ?
check n@@ ci@@ c , maybe he's got a record . then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location .
well , i need to study , and ...
it's what bi@@ an@@ ch@@ i and bu@@ on@@ o injected into one of their victims .
what do you think i should get ?
i believe i said i'd be tempted .
see if you've been making it with my mother .
aw christ , jerry . we can't see anything now , it's too dark . let's forget it .
stop being such a bitch , sal .
i didn't say anything . what's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour , colonel ?
actually , you sing .
it is ?
well , i'm here putting together a show . it's a benefit really .
look . we're talking about life and death here . i don't know why we're even having this conversation .
sure , sure . i've heard it before .
we have reason to believe she came this way ... might have stopped in this area ... did she stop here ?
can't we go back , charlie ?
no kidding .
tracks ?
what ?
fuck you .
what about cortina ?
well , i'm getting tired of it . i need your attention .
hell , doc , i've been everything from a ho@@ op@@ la man with a two-bit car@@ ny show to a top mechanic and bull goose ca@@ ts@@ kin@@ ner for every gy@@ po lo@@ ggin ' operation in the northwest till the army taught me what my natural bent was .
not eating like you used to , that's what .

honey , i could sit ...
you're welcome .
to him ? he's a sick freak .
is it real ?
more important than what is when ?
let me tell you guys a story . in one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named elois .
i can't take shorthand .
then why do you still like her ?
what's wrong ?
target ...
maybe it does . don't patronize me gordon .
then you'll do it ?
all his victims are women ... his obsession is women , he lives to hunt women . but not one women is hunting him - except me . i can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would . i have to go to belvedere .
exactly . now i've been thinking - -
we're preparing a con@@ vo@@ y for a delivery to peking .
remain calm .
how nice .
... and is dumber than my hind end . like that bobby lynn de@@ x@@ ter ...
no , that won't do any good .
do you always drive like this ?
jeffrey . pro@@ je@@ cti@@ le vomit .
i'm done . find another cab .
are you nuts or something ? what the hell is that going to do ?
ten years , i think . what i miss ?
what's going on ? i'm going on my second job this month , and now i'm going on unemployment .
course he ain't never killed nobody . why'd you say that , pace ?
will you please wait a second . shelly . please . murray told me : the hot leads ...
you left just when you were becoming interesting .
is this true , brother bu@@ yl ?
listen , just take one of mine when we get back . don't worry about it . i did the forum with marge and , frankly , once is enough in anyone's life .
alright , i was wrong . there is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school head@@ master .
what ?
i don't want to talk about that .
me ?
what ?
you're about an inch away from insubordination !
as long as you're asking ... i think you have a pretty good voice .
gone ?
open that door , you'll see . your brother's there ... conrad . he's there . it's your birthday party ...
hey ... wake up .
haven't got one .
good night , then .
yeah ... well , that's not the way the world works . if you keep being too honest , the world will eventually find a way to destroy you .
men are to stay in file , sergeant major !
... leeloo .
but we had heat baby . passion ! fire ! we owe it to ourselves to fuse together . at least one more time .
what time was this ?
what kind of friend ? was he a boy friend ? an old friend ? new friend ?
more or less .
you don't have squat .
if they get set up in time , which i doubt . and even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little latin fellas , not a big black guy driving a ford .
you still in the market for a real boy ?
hy@@ g@@ ge@@ li@@ g a mo@@ te dem . je@@ g he@@ ter leland palmer .
my daughters - - yes , my daughters .
yes , it's unholy .
fir@@ en@@ ze .
or something will be able to see us .
disappointing . it only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum , and ... ah ... they're not very happy and ... well , the guys have decided they want to ... ah , re-@@ think the entire concept and ... look , i don't like having to do this , okay ? ... but ... i mean , what i mean is ... ah , i'm going to have to ... ah , let you go - -
you have a card in here ?
yes ... acknowledge , master control ...
oh , you don't appreciate it . her pictures don't do her justice . why , gallagher , she's que@@ en@@ ly - she is que@@ en@@ ly - and i know queens ! and oh , has she got herself a nose - and i know noses too . that little sno@@ zz@@ le of hers is the berries , i tell you . and is she cute when she throws that little sno@@ zz@@ le to the high heavens !
poor little flower . just dropped her petals and folded her tent ...
you think i was a getaway pilot for the assassination , don't you ?
it's chemistry , andy . nothing more . mutated an@@ ti@@ gen@@ s concentrated in the heart of the infe@@ ctor unlock a vaccine - like chain reaction in the infe@@ c@@ tee . there were not many bio-@@ chemists working in the twelfth century , but with today's technology it's possible to synthe@@ size any chemical imaginable . when i discovered this ancient cure i knew who to go to .
you think you're so smart , mrs . stone . you wanted to be near jabez . it looked like your big chance tonight , but you're wrong , you can't win him back - - not that way .
you , madam , are a heartless wench .
but she was different . there was a light in her eyes ... and she had this voice . it was scary , all that pain coming out of that little body . like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice . i helped her . and i promised her that i'd always be there ... to protect her . see ? it's not about what's in her head . it's what's in mine . i can't let go of the promise . it's ... like ... it's all i have left .
what you're telling me is that i'm dead . right ?
i'm disgusting .
i don't have any business here . i came here for you , i didn't have any business .
he already did once .
i - - lost something .
as your father knew , things need to be sacrificed to the future .
of bodies .
do you know how i felt , diz ?
you tol me you w@@ u@@ unt ask me again til i'm ready ...
what the hell you looking at me like that for ?
' i choose my friends for their looks , and my enemies for their brains ... ' you're too smart to be my friend . besides , as i always tell my kids , be careful to pick the right friends !
you called the police ?
fascinating animals , fascinating .
- - i have a feeling you're going to tell me .
i don't ...
you can call me jimmy again . sher@@ yl peter@@ sen said james sounds too pretentious .
oh !
i'd be happy too , if i had such a great family .
okay .
i don't know .
since i can remember , ma'am .
no , i have my things in the car .
yikes .

this ... ? oh , this is just ... this is the bill .
yes , madam . and now madam will sleep . it is not long ' till the train .
i heard your playing .
to the best of my recollection , neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation .
claire ?
you always say that ... i really care for lester , don't i ?
i really think i should try and locate it immediately . might be something important .
i want the autopsy report , where is it , minnesota ?
good . glad to see they're together at last . they don't get along . promotion . top job . most unfair . quite a fuss at the ministry .
jean and scotty never have to worry .
do you think we can turn it on ?
yes .
please . i want to see you home . all right ?
just curious . back to business . ever heard of a man called nix ? dor@@ o@@ thea ?
look , if you want to kill jews on your free time , fine . we need you to raise money . will you do that for us ?
it wasn't loaded . i didn't put the bullets in it .
we'll be on teams , me and you ?
you realize you're no@@ stal@@ gi@@ c for an era you weren't even born in ?
got run over by a car .
yes ...
why is that childish ? your living with the guy ! i'm just asking how it's going .
she is not there . the coffin is gone .
give me the camera , joe .
get off the grift , roy .
not next week's either ... listen ... you tell that to giovanni , not me .
i just thought with all the sadness ... you wouldn't want ...
he must be a good friend .
okay .
whats your business with elektra king ?
but i'll tell you something , what i said in their , still goes . you and your family have been through a lot in the last two days ... not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago .
tell it to my daughter .
what music ? there ain't no music .
when was the last time you talked to your son ?
that's a new one . is that what they're teaching now at stanford ?
no . i'm visiting relatives .
just some young guy . around twenty years old . dark hair .
what ?
really ?
anything good ?
that's what the two policemen said , sir .
not right now , jerry .
michael , believe me . you know the kid's a little crazy sometimes . i vouched for him and he'll come through . i promise . i'll talk to him and straighten him out . don't worry , ok ?
phoenix ?
were you in nam ?
you'd co@@ sme@@ tically alter simone to look like me ?
get real . i'm faster than you .
i'd be glad to . not now , of course - - with you alone .
positively not !
this just might be our ticket !
i will wave to you .
that your gate down there ?
no , no , no . we'll use the floss to get to the ledge .
you better hope not . cause it's like they say , four can keep a secret , if three are dead .
your honor , this is absurd . the woman's obviously in love with him .
you show the picture to your husband . he likes it and hangs it on the wall . the girl is lying on a bea@@ r@@ skin rug .
fun .
i have it here .
we don't mess with ac@@ ce@@ s@@ sor@@ ies .
what do you do ?
all right , all right .
you didn't ?
kyle ?
alright .
i'll say it again , all right ? you told brandt . he told me . i know what happened . yes ? yes ?
it's quite un@@ important , mr . mitchell . after all , you got what you wanted .
we can live like this ? off the blood of animals ?
them who ?
okay . then you'll be sitting on the <u> left </u> .
the real nazis . hitler , goebbels , they talked about jews in@@ ce@@ ss@@ an@@ tly ... you ever read their dia@@ ries ? ...
you're home , then .
right <u> at </u> him ?
yeah , but how am i gonna get my arm fixed ?
well , there's a problem .
uhm hmm . some range .
i can look and see .
you got any money ?
jennyhaydn .
you get out of here ! if any of you men think you can come busting in here -
all right then ! yes !
he's looking for something . won't stop until he finds it . sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want .
no .
three months .
how fer you going with them sacks full of war@@ sh ?
hello .
one more " dude " out of you and i'm gonna slap the shit outa you , okay ? now i'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you , man ! : check it ...
pacifica , california ... that's a long ways away .
george . . .
you killed me , remember ? now i have to hide out here with you . where have you been ?
is he in the bathroom ?
i'm impressed with you too , jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bed@@ ded down for the night .
what do you know about it ?
i'm ahead of you ... partner .
... and there's no truth that 10 % of that money will go into your swiss bank account ?
i want it - -
yes . your husband did show remarkable fore@@ sight in taking those pictures . and , yes , absent a swimming pool , the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious . but bonnie , who is the real victim here ? let me suggest the following . your husband , who on a prior occasion slapped you - - beat you - -
she'll be here next weekend . why don't you come too , james ? i'll * show you the marshes properly . if you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from siberia .
not if they're starting a war .
i didn't want him meeting me here .
well , i don't trust her . i never have .
there must be something i can do , something i can say to make this up to you ? ... just tell me what it is , i'll say it . i'll do it . i don't want you to hate me .
it means concentration of ambition , desire , and sacrifice such as no other profession demands ... and i'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary , can't be - just someone . to give so much for almost always so little ...
looks like the curse is still at work .
there's something i've been meaning to tell you , heather .
yes .
you know , when you gave him a beatin ' .
you know where she is ?
brother minister he often talked about you . he loves you , loves you like his own son . says you are the best , his greatest minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him .
never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course .
that is true .
that's right . i want this flashed to all section immediately .
get back ! now !
hey , george . . .
what he's trying to say is : every team needs a mascot ...
there's no other way , boys . i'm going to have to take her in ... the hard way .
come on , harry . this is america , land of the free . i thought we might go skinny dipping . for starters .
this is not an intelligent way to approach this .
when i was a little boy i was taught to ride and be a gentleman - - at school , it was a monastery , i learned to pray and lie - - and - - -
no kidding . i looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen .
now , now .
no one gets to be vice president by being that clean .
cooch . where the fuck did they send us ?
let me borrow your car .
chalk up another victory for billy-@@ boy's one man war on crime .
i didn't think you did . if you had , i wouldn't have asked you again , because i'd have remembered . how old ?
oh we ... we ...
guess you missed it .
put kelly on too .
were we always explorers ?
you oughta be careful yourself . might end up cutting your throat .
attitude ? me ? i think that <u> you </u> guys should be more enthusiastic . shit , we've been trying to get laid forever , and tonight's the night we've been waiting for . we're in this together . don't back out on me now !
no , it's kissing again . you don't want to hear it .
people just ... disappear .
let me have some apple pie , helen . who said anything about war ? all i said was that some gulls ...
his letters will keep .
killing himself .
it's okay . forget it .
you're not a stalker or anything , right ?
that's what koessler wants us to believe . to discredit low .
he can't hear you . he's just a deaf and dumb indian !
big threat . tv would rea@@ m you .
it's a test .
it's a pair of earrings . i saw ' em in the mall one day , and i thought , damn , those would look good on those beautiful ear@@ lo@@ bes . so i bought ' em . and i said to myself , next time erin says something nice , does something nice , i'll surprise her with ' em . know how long ago that was ? six months . in six months , you haven't said one nice thing to me . that's a long time .
i'm here .
okay , i'll take care of jessica .
dear miss lau@@ ry ... i take pen in hand to let you know ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them com - an@@ ches the late mister futterman told us about ...
yeah . what ?
i know this sounds insane ellen , but ... telling you all of this , writing the book ... it feels good . don't get me wrong - i feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders ... when i tell you what i have done - i can't believe it is me ... yet i know it was . this is like a p@@ ur@@ ging for me ...
a date . what , are you a hooker ? what do you mean a date ? i've got a wife back home . i just came over to talk for a few minutes .
whatta you mean ? me ?
automatic .
what do you think ? he said in life there's no free ride .
i did , didn't i ? look ! a shooting star .
you were terrific , too !
it doesn't make any sense . it par@@ al@@ y@@ zes him ... puts him into a coma ... then keeps him alive .
night is when you want to sleep , but the dry heat keeps you to@@ ssin ' and turnin ' . it's when you wish the sun was ba@@ kin ' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of .
ra@@ ke her .
oh , nick ... nick !
answer af@@ fir@@ mati@@ ve@@ ly . simply . keep those answers to three words . you weren't ` part of a group , ' you were her an@@ es@@ the@@ si@@ o@@ logist . isn't that right ?
ah ... no ...
i wish i were like you . look at my staff , they won't work , they listen to no one .
i'm glad you let me talk to you . you used to not let me talk to you .
if i read this board right now , they want you to accept bon@@ te@@ cou@@ 's offer .
if it makes you feel any better , to get your number , i had to cough up two r@@ oun@@ d-@@ trip tickets to amsterdam and a case of mini-@@ ba@@ i@@ le@@ ys .
where is he , donald ?
that's thoughtful . zi@@ z good , you try this ?
your nephew doesn't want a drink .
i would have said it was impossible , but i believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful .
you gave me what ? ! knots ! you gave me knots in here every day - - you made me scared of everything !
my wife sent me here , myra . for the money . she's waiting .
nah .
go ahead . ask her to the prom . get it over with .
i'm going back to the hotel .
a thousand .
it you really loved me , steven , you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds .
my word is good , and it'll always be good . when did i ever give my word to you ?
special agent scully - -
really ?
well , i like to speculate . this book i'm reading right now , a woman in colorado says she lived in ireland a hundred and fifty years ago . her name was bri@@ de@@ y murphy - and she gives names and dates and where she lived . she was hypnotized . big bestseller .
i wouldn't call it victory . it's more like ... self im@@ mo@@ lation .
i can't believe this . i always said i'd never end up like this . i thought i'd make something of myself , do something with my life . you know , be successful . have a big house , a family . now i'm gonna end up just like daddy .
you'd drifted right through the core systems . it's blind luck that deep-@@ salvage team caught you when they ... are you all right ?
too bad we have to waste all that time .
the dope ring . you must know what's going on in this hotel . why do you think we're here ?
he's earned an early retirement . but enough about losers ; buzz fazeli is history . lets talk about your future . i wanna show you something .
yeah . me and patchett go way back .
your government always been pretty happy to have that line . the que@@ sti@@ on's just been where to draw it
good for you .
no , listen . you have no idea of the kind of pressure i'm under right now .
okay , tootsie .
and i'm not even pretty .
i'm sorry . where'd they send her ?
it's like , every day i see a beautiful woman . i'm not used to that . i'm used to seeing a beautiful woman , i don't know , once a week . i can't handle it .
i didn't want it to turn out this way .
not the happiest of souls . " art is a form of ca@@ tha@@ r@@ sis , and love is a permanent flop . "
stephanie ?
you live a phony cheap co@@ p-@@ out existence .
all right . get a hold of yourself . take a deep breath , let it out slowly and tell me who you are .
for what ?
now what are we doing ? i don't get any of this shit !
captain .
he's back . hey my brother , can i borrow a copy of your ' hey soul classics ' ?
french fries . i like to eat them pretty good .
don't worry about me , i'll grab a cab ... i can afford it , you know .
it wasn't like that .
i mean home . india .
really ?
where ?
do you remember a case - - 1956 - - hazel dobkins ?
i can see through walls . i could surprise her . the only thing i can't see through is lead , that's why i didn't see the power source at the amusement park .
kind of feeling your oa@@ ts this morning . i haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while , but that doesn't mean you're too old .
are you sure you saw that ? in the rain - - it may have <u> looked </u> like it changed shape - -
what're you saying ?
most we've ever used is half a cc .
i hope so , too .
he was harry's driver ?
you go see agents - - or equ@@ ity calls , open casting calls . and ad agencies - - commercials - - you don't get work , you just go around .
- - these preposterous inven@@ tions , would be better su@@ it@@ ed to the pages of amazing tales magazine . if the editors of the manhattan ar@@ gus see fit to publish the ran@@ tings of a di@@ sor@@ dered mind , perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter ! but i doubt it . i most seriously doubt it . as i doubt also that you could find a home at amazing tales , a peri@@ o@@ di@@ cal which i have enjoyed for many years . yours sincerely , et cetera .
let me try . computer ? computer ? ...
please .
sorry ?
we need a break , that's all ! nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted casanova frankenstein !
not really . maybe a little .
not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened . we both have ...
he thinks you're being a little careless . he made the point several times .
well ... we'll see .
let my kid go .
you already asked me that . why do you insist on making me repeat myself ?
watch it !
prove it . if we can't get back , it's still just a theory .
captain - - i might have a way to find them .
oh , i suppose you could do better .
he did ? i play the tuba
but you promised ! i've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised !
something wrong , jesse ?
you know them personally ?
you are engaged in an unauthorized procedure . check cy@@ ber@@ ne@@ tic manual f - 45 . if you do no have an f - 45 , you are in violation . this is a double a restricted precinct . remain where you are . authorities will arrive shortly .
we can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here .
and you'll face that danger head-@@ on . as if i could stop you . and you have my complete support in this matter . anything you can do to rev@@ it@@ ali@@ ze this neighborhood would be a blessing .
yes , but we're divorced .
you're being terribly tolerant , aren't you ?
happy new year .
i guess .
he won't be looking for you . just be careful . buy a book . keep your sunglasses on .
thanks , lloyd . but i didn't find what i was looking for . oh can you do me a favor and clean up ? collins can't know we were here .
meet me tra@@ tin@@ o's at nine .
don't you trust your own eyes .
you feel sorry for the husband ?
i'm not nuts .
she is married , but not to him . another man , much older . she has four kids . the young guy works for her . and i think she likes kinky sex .
no ! i have a boyfriend . he loves me .
twenty pounds on delivery
i hope not . now , as soon as you do what i told you , have plan-r radio@@ ed to the wing .
you'll die if you leave here .
i know the feeling ...
okay . see ya .
now , judy , it isn't anything to get - -
my disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case . i spent three years on the stage , you know . remind me sometime to re@@ gale you with my lea@@ r .
that casy . he might a been a preacher , but--@@ he seen a lot a things clear . he was like a lan@@ ter@@ n@@ --he helped m@@ w see things too .
i do not seek forgiveness .
i finally found my story .
what are you talking about ?
you think i haven't figured it out ? just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free . i'm a veteran reporter . i've seen your kind before , the under@@ belly of crime .
let's face it , it could have been wonderful .
darling , it's good ri@@ d@@ dance . let her go . and while you're at it , fire that clark kent . he hasn't been here in days . he hasn't even called .
i gotta go . love ya mom .

lee , clarence . please don't insult me . call me lee .
the coca is my responsibility !
it's called ... the gritty palace .
- - when you say forty-five minutes or an hour , do you mean continuous time ? just continually , without stopping ?
but , hell , this is nothing compared to venezuela . when i was vice president , ike sent me down there like a blocking back . they threw rocks , broke out our windows , almost overturned the car . read six crises , bob . boy , pat was brave !
created ?
hey , it's ... been two years - -
uh ... we'll let you know .
but where are you going ?
i came on a bus .
all or nothing . you want to roll them for me ?

this is him .
we are at least four acts short , will , if you are looking for disaster .

okay .
walter , what'm i gonna tell lebowski ?
ram it in and break it off !
what do you think your salary would be - - for such a trip ?
it's walkin ' pretty slow at this point .
she said , your name was alvy singer .
i bet .
not a chance !
you just got crushed in a car . you're bleeding all over your self . and you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball , as if , at this very moment , people weren't plotting your demise ...
hundreds ! which one is your pet ?
is there anything else you wanted to ask me while i'm up ? ... when was the last time you wore pink ? when was the last time you drank soup standing up ? final call for strange questions at two in the morning .
what is it ?
i forgive you .
why don't you pick him up yourself ?
landon carter . i was driving the car that - -
and your folks didn't understand ?
yeah , i got the key , so i come here at night , hang out , read comic books , play music .
no , not anyone else - just me .
you're good with ' remo@@ tes , ' but how are you against something living ?
need to lose some weight .
i just ... wanted to be put on my own for a while . clear my head .
a neighbor saw your car leave .
oh my god ! my - - my tap co@@ stu@@ me's gone .
bullshit .
oh , you think ?
any ideas ?
home ?
in a wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license denial , rothstein followed several ...
to the stars .
yes .
what is that smile on your face ? is there anything wrong with me ?
louder !
i told you he's crazy .
- thank you , m . but this is more than your man can handle . are we in agreement ?
don't say anything else .
not really . but i knew this narcotics cop one time . told me that in a raid , the whole package never gets back to the station . his exact words .
sixth is faster .
i asked , but ya never helped nothin ' ! - - like the bible sez , ya don't get no second chance .
are you and dr . woodly engaged ?
like what ?
me too .
you saved me .
how do you mean , start ?
you cruise a . i . ' s , you end up on tape .

good morning , vanessa ! i hope you have on clean underwear .
they're my friends .

well , it's ... it's sort of an ... an ` incident ' really ...
be it fit for your wife , green jack ?
allegedly , what i am saying is your situation will be con@@ currently improved if i had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now .
you still didn't have to choke me .
... look good on kimberly .
but the variety of food here is very pleasing ... i commend you .
think of it as a rite of passage to manhood .
go on .
she is not your birth mother , is she ?
i know ! i just had to let one go because i couldn't afford him !
good idea . mark@@ o . we're hungry .
a lot of things fell apart up there .
it'll be okay . i don't think you should wait out here though . i think you should go home . can you drive this car ?
i'm her legal guardian , not you or anybody else , and i alone know what's best for her . end of discussion .
you scurvy sh@@ y@@ ster bastard ! watch your language ! you're talking to a doctor of journalism !
i don't understand why you were dragged out here , sir . it's hardly worth wasting your time@@ --a no-@@ nothing case like this .
oh . oh !
i already tossed that out . somethin ' you should'a done to that woman long ago ... how she treated you . of course , that's none of my business .
all right , all right . jesse james never yelled at folk ...
for about one year .
in my mother's drawer .
so you see , this post is very important to me right now .
kirk here .
thinking there's someone who looks like you , walking around the street somewhere . wonder if i saw him i'd think it was you ?
yeah , i think it is . and i don't mean everybody's got to be married , have kids - - it's more like , knowing where you're from , where you belong , what feeds you , where you can go no matter what happens ... knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here .
okay . na@@ ze@@ er , okay ?
what happened to them ?
can you put me in the ring with him ?
it's just a nightmare .
yah , is this marge ?
now hurry , hurry . i will watch ! your desires may be my pleasure also ... our fitting climax to an evening's enter - ta@@ in@@ ment . you must ... hurry now .
i want a@@ mp@@ he@@ ta@@ mines .

i am so upset , monsieur rick . you know i can't understand - -
yeah , but don't pick me up . my father may think it's strange . i'll walk over to your house . i'll be there at eight o'clock .
no way can anything be proved . all they have are some wolf hairs . no one believes in werewolves .
don't fuck with me . i don't want to hurt you .
are you afraid of anything ?
and that is the last time any ...
what about ?
the bay of pigs ? ... that was kennedy's screw-up . how does that threaten us ?

uh-huh .
oh . okay . i gotcha .

well , i'm not really sure what you're trying to say . it's funny , i suppose . but it seems glib and fa@@ ci@@ le to just make fun of how idiotic these people are .
what ?
great . terrific . glad you could make it .
why ?
this is a mistake . i shouldn't be here .
what ?
will you stop ! ... ... i'm in love with you ...

i saw his ta@@ m@@ bur@@ la@@ ine , you know . wonderful .
i don't have it easy like you , alright . there's no red carpet laid out for me .
okay . here it is . ever want to be someone else ? now you can . no kidding . only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes . visit j . m . inc . , mer@@ tin@@ -@@ fle@@ mm@@ er building . etc . , etc .
here are two quarters . when you lose these , you're not going to get anymore .
how's today then ?
it's worth the effort . believe me . besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage .
it don't look together .
now i know ...
he'll live if that's what you mean . but somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs .
it's just a mongoose .
i'll answer anything .

look at my face .
it was the pl@@ o .
amanda , i told you to go to the infirmary and lie down . you never listen .

you never told him ?
earl ... it's me , valiant .
i didn't see you this morning .
yes , there's no time to spare . and those fibers can be quite tenacious .
you'd better hurry - - i think it's going to rain .
now go get dressed . we have things to do .
yes , i am .
stained with lo@@ ser@@ ness . oh , i like it . can i use that . it'd be dynamite on inter@@ office memor@@ an@@ da .
can i give you my testimony ?
i waited up till midnight .
right there -
what matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years . so ' tie a yellow ribbon ' sounds a little flat . so what ? nobody's gonna hear it , jack . nobody . so why should you care ?
no .
was there ?
i was doing it for them .
haven't slept , have you ?
yeah .
was the trip okay ?
maybe not ... i don't know . i'm not sure i'm gonna go . she doesn't need her bur@@ n-@@ out of a father there ...

you drink rum ?
we're standin ' on broken treaty ground , ray . this ain't supposed to be here . it'll poison the water .
i've given you no word to keep , admiral . in my judgment , you simply have no alternative .
look , frank , when i say don't answer it , that means answer it . you can do that for me at least . three zebra .
saw my mom ... i'm with debi , and i'm on my way to the reunion .
... we must try to communicate with them .
you do , you do . you're just not saying .
no . but that's why we hated him . we admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the party and yet he had a better life than any of us . he didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad . he got everything from them , everything . he was fil@@ thi@@ er than any of us party members .
you really have me con@@ sorting with a cast of sordid characters , don't you , mr . garrison .
be careful !
would you like to tell me ?
he's jealous , yes , but <u> that </u> jealous ? he's too cautious .

never mind it ? that's not my money ! that's bru@@ ce's money !
like your cocaine , i suppose . the " high " lasts several hours . we would receive small amounts of it ... as a reward for our labor .
what made it grow ? do you know ?
does this have something to do with that man you saw ?
they're dead , john .
you know what i'd like to see ? meat in a cone . you could put corned beef hash in a cone , or chopped liver .
hey , lover . whatcha doing ?
you know they won't do it . it's up to you . you gotta be strong .

and that's when i told you my father was this famous vi@@ ro@@ logist and you said , " hey , he could make a germ and we could steal it ! "
he's out of prison ?

unfortunate that i know the truth ?
are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem .

i've left those pills for you .
i mean , i know you're upset and all , but can't you just take a sedative ?
malcolm's okay for now . i gave him a shot of morphine .
are you going to help me up ?

like what ?
i gotta piss .
i can't do it ! take care of andy for me !
i'm not as tough as you think i am .
i had a meeting with tu@@ d@@ dy around eleven o'clock and here i am a back-up guy .
i think so . i tried to get into your cab one night , and now you want to come and take me away .
well , it may be a joke , but it's his nose . he can't help having a horrible great nose , it's the only one he's got . and his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it .
i did it myself . i read a magazine article about how to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze small spaces .
yes , amy ?
you'll take care of it ? not this time . no way . i bought it fair and square . and we open tonight .
i just wanted to find out what was going on ... but now that i'm here it seems strange , doesn't it ?
magda ? she's not my grandmother - - actually she rents the apartment right next to mine . her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone .
i'll pick the first job ! i mean ... i know a girl down at the bank . see if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money .
at the time , i thought , i got six kids , some of ' em want to go to college . i can't afford to lose my job . i told myself i was being honorable . but there's nothing honorable in what i did . maybe that's why they picked me for the job . maybe they knew what kind of man i was .
carl , that's insane .
no . i knew that i'm not smarter than you are .
shut up . you have bread , don't you , and a toaster of some kind ?
not that we are giving in one inch , but tell us ... what is in your mind ?
thanks . good night , mrs . mitchell .
raise a hand to me and ... .
she tryin ' to work your ass against me , ain't she ?
you're lost ?
how did this happen ?
where are we going ?
storage , i think .
took me about three hours .

i don't blame him . jean-louis - - do you know where this monsieur flix lives ?
i wouldn't dream of it .

oh , and why am i an asshole ?
okay .
i ... i wasn't thinking . i just did it .
sorry , miss schaefer , but i've given up writing on spe@@ c .
i don't know . it all happened so fast . if i'd had a chance to think about it i guess i probably would've been scared but ... swear to god , doc , i just don't know .
all right , you don't wanna fall down , so now you gotta take a rest . so , you enjoy the suspension . ' cause there's nothin ' you can do about it . let the commissioner and the d . a . jerk you around . so you wait .

huh ?
you mustn't give way to despair . you must wait .
bloom , bloom , maybe it's not true .
she's mistaken .

damn ... lost again . sorry .

someone has seen her . someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars . she is your girl friend , isn't she ?
now , icky , i don't need you winding yourself up . i need you focused and in control .
or murdered , like nix .
i'll be alright .
sure , jimmy .
no , no . i come every couple of years . i always think i'm going to stay . i'm from cape town originally
fuck , yeah ! i told you so . and you can tell'em all i told you so .
turn that jungle music off . we ain't in africa .
no .
you father was seduced by the dark side of the force . he ceased to be ana@@ kin skywalker and became darth vader . when that happened , the good man who was your father was destroyed . so what i have told you was true ... from a certain point of view .
let's try this way .
i'm just going to keep asking until you answer . i'm sure there's plenty of tape .
he says - -
scottie - -
i'm hungry .
sorry , but the situation has changed .
i don't know . i can't really tell from here .
won ? ! such a small word will never do ! this is victory , jeanne , this is ... glory !
it could have been a nightmare ... sometimes they dream about the old murders .
well yes .
but i suppose you know the answer .
they sent us to tell ya . we pulled the detail .
that's alright , i'll figure something out .
come here .
oh-@@ kay ...
think it might be ... ?
come on , a w@@ u@@ ss like me ? the stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back ?
how was school ?
i can't believe you just rolled a joint in here .
shit , mick , come on in , let me get you a drink . sit down , lou .

krieger can get it . right ?

you have to hear this , i can never touch you , i@@ sh@@ ma@@ el . not once , not ever . there's no half - way . as much as i know it hurts you , you have to let this go .
j . j . , if you think -
oh ... has your luggage been brought in ?
all right .
thelma ! i'm not gonna talk about this ! now find another way or give me the goddamn map and i will ! you understand ?
look after that suit , eh . barbara chose it for me .
" soon " . or at least sooner than never .
you know ?
of course . mrs . tasker . and what were you going with the international terrorist , carlos the jack@@ al ? taking di@@ c@@ tation ?
excuse me ?
mmm , not really . but you're gonna love this one .
uh@@ huh .
- opening of the opera -
i'm not sure i do , archie .
the official cause of death was a cardiac arrest .
there might be an opening for a manager at sa@@ le@@ m next spring .
when was the last time you cleaned this place ?
no further questions . thank you mrs . phillips .
i've got work to do .
is that a trick question ? c'mon , i can't be the only one who thinks this is cool .
i will , i promise .
yeah , well , if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up . she's an amateur , just like del was .
only 1 in 14 male app@@ li@@ can@@ ts make it through st@@ el@@ lar navigation . so what do you think your chances are ?
i ain't heard of nothin ' .
it's not the first . there's been several . and our field office in rapid city is getting a lot of heat ... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit .
oh . nothing ... sitting .
you can still work .
an unholy trinity ...
are you still following me ?
i felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide . life seems so much not worth the living , death such an easy way out .
how do i know you were gonna show us one ?
who are you ? who are you working for , huh ?
we're going home . we're going home together ...
i am a man of peace .
also , this is your bill for the last week .
oh i was walkin ' down lime street one day ...
i know , maya , but you'll understand when you see this man . i really need your strength .
blow it up ?
it looks stupid . it's a pinky ring . it's a man's ring .
aren't you off-@@ duty ?
not exactly the kind of thing a secret service agent can throw himself on top of .
no ... nervous . it would be very rough , carol , if you weren't along .
you're pissing me off again , ed .
... which should ex@@ c@@ lu@@ de you from any objective discussion . but keep in mind , even the arts aren't free of aggressive content , nor the institution of marriage .
oh . sorry . you're right , field trip partner is a big commitment .
you lose trust in someone and it's over , done , gone , forever .
believe you me , they're gonna do anything - - and i mean absolutely anything - - to stop that word from gettin ' out .
[ the boss did or his brother . ]
you're going to have to get a new one .
give it to master kent . he will see it right@@ fully home . wessex gives his purse to viola .
i'm a monster . exactly .
why ?
grea@@ te pate , but i'm going to have to motor if i want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow .
i believe in it for some people . i mean , for me it was silly , i was confused going in . so i just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately .
see that wasn't so bad .
a good deal , like this with us , for burnett will be good only temporarily . he'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever . life is dust , make it while you can . he's ambitious .
jeremy listen to what - -
nah .
oh , no , no , no . this is no big deal , you know ? i can come down and , and get you out .
he's dead . they're both dead . you don't understand what is on this ship . this is a being that kills . that's what he does . that's all he does . and he is very good at it .
do you see a toilet here you think is really me ?
that's it ?
there's nothing much to laugh at .
did you get the paint ?
well - - this would be goodnight .
oh , thank you , sir . thank you .
he did .
and you've forgotten yours .
as much as i want . when these plants bud i'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed .
he's doing a good job .
who is that ?
i assumed because of the train .
ms . po@@ mer@@ oy ... what's going on ?
do you want me to take his leg off ? where's the fourth ?
and end up a hun@@ ch@@ back like my old man ? you think i'm crippled ? you shoulda caught him the end of a day .
antonio paid for it .
we're working as hard as we can - -
it buys things , just like any other kind .
how are we going to live , wolfi ? do you want me to go into the streets and beg ?
what's that got to do with it ?
even poor people have t . v . s
several things . hello , fred . we're hungry again . yeah , and lots of onions . oh , and coffee .
yes ?
let her go .
what kinds of questions ?
you don't know , believe me . they bribe the guards . the guards turn a blind eye . they're bringing in car@@ t@@ loads , food , tobacco , liquor , french cosmetics , and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn .
you must be feeling better , if you're looking for sex again .
me ? ! i wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you . you brought down so much fuckin ' heat on me . i mean , every time i meet somebody here , the big question is do i know you .
but , somehow , it was ka@@ ts arse that was stung by ne@@ tt@@ les . and you rubbed it with a dan@@ deli@@ on leaf .
now , wait a second - -
... she didn't , i didn't ask her out ?
think about it .
yes . but look at this me@@ d@@ scan ...
well i interviewed damon once for the show . he was a real obnoxious fuck . any way , the second one , christine perkins , she had a part in stab 2 , didn't she ? she was playing cici .
the car@@ ry@@ all will come and lift off the spice har@@ ve@@ ster . try and get in close over the har@@ ve@@ ster ... you'll find this interesting sire . - - the duke ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ates the or@@ ni@@ th@@ op@@ ter in the direction of the har@@ ve@@ ster . paul can see ...
he was a very wealthy man , he looked after me since i was young .
maybe it is . i wouldn't know .
that's not an answer .
don't worry about them . they're at that party , getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about mcgovern and stuff .
ah , it's a grand title .
oh .
bru@@ no@@ 's girlfriend .
this scam we got going here was your
why is that ?
this is just show and tell .
did the mescaline just kick in ? or was that debbie reynolds in a silver af@@ ro wig ? !
really , i don't know enough about it to ...
of course ...
not chopped up . not chopped up like that . i mean , what do i got left ? coupla articles . a medal or two . plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore .
oh , yes , george .
shouldn't we turn away ?
can you help ?
yeah , right , it runs from the processing station right into the sub@@ level here .
prosit .
the statue of liberty .
nothin ' . salvy was out of line . he was drunk or somethin ' , i dunno . anyway , the wind@@ up was i gave him a beatin ' . tommy called me down , and we straightened it out . it's all forgotten about .
you can't just stay in your house .
i saw her . julia . alive . i saw everything .
i don't know , christine . perhaps it's because i feel attacked .
the fuck i'm not . i don't care what the doctor says - -
i'm here , honey . i'm right here .
he's trying to be an actor .
levi ? who names their kid levi - -
these ob@@ ser@@ vers were doing something . a test ... i think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes .
it feels fine now , jabez .
other guy ?
tell me you don't hate me louis . i did it for you -
yes - - who spoke up ?
home ?
but i found you . all the clues led me here ...
i'm ye boy .
no .
just remember : they think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there .
to have a good time with you until you have to go .
well , well , sure ... because he's a singer and you're a singer , you know , so it's perfect . so you're trying to suffocate yourself . it-@@ it makes perfect sense . uh , uh , that's a perfect analytic ... kind of insight .
does that mean we have to cut him loose ?
he . can't . answer .
you have no dis@@ pu@@ tes over women ?
he knows the first mrs . kane socially - that's the answer we got .
and let's put this together . okay ? shel ? say okay .
seems like they're cooperating . hopefully i'll be out of here and on my way very soon .
make him stop .
i did not burn you . i did not give you up to anyone !
her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner . first time in a long time she's been willing .
it's obvious you're not a woman .
his face . allie , look at his face .
where are the stockings he strangled them with ?
the hu@@ tu@@ -@@ tutsi thing . the bbc faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace ac@@ cor@@ ds . and the u . n . wants the banquet room for that day , a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony . can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish ?
i know . he sends a check every week to his dear gra@@ y-@@ haired old mother .
let's not talk about that . how'd you get home ?
yeah , her name's ka@@ v@@ lo@@ va , why ?
does that make it right ...
do i know you ?
i have a letter , ma'am .
it's nanotechnology , isn't it ? machines the size of molecules ...
wait till the ma@@ i-@@ ta@@ is wear off .
castor's still alive - - technically . he's a tur@@ nip , on total life-@@ support ...

he's gotten involved - -
i knew it , soon as i saw they were offering a reward .
okay .
dan ! the spare costumes ! i can't believe you kept them .
f@@ lo , i'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee .
you're a liar !
yeah , let's bury her .
hi , ma .

subtlety ?

not quite .
i don't want to hear any more today .
i don't know brady .
they're gonna kill us . they get us across the border , they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us .
yes sir .
" yeah , right " ... well why not ? what's so wrong with me ?
so ?
i'm very smart .
she married an accountant named stanley kestenbaum .
you're a grun@@ gy little phoenix , you know that ? keep up the good work .
damn it , ben - -

i won't wear your stuff . i promise .
professor , you guys gotta see this . dwight , come here .
he's waiting . he's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think .
there's a shark ...
the germans are dropping men on bomb sites .

what did he say ? what did he say ?
i called my wife !
yes , we call it a winch . and these are sh@@ rou@@ ds , and these are stays .

that's it ? that's all you have to say ?
alright . alright . there will be nothing left .

maybe eve can guess . she's psychic .
what you don't know about women is a lot .
will you listen to this man ? will you just listen to him ? you really caused a panic on a public beach , you shoot up the place , god knows who could've been injured - - what if somebody de - ci@@ des to sue us ? that could ruin us .
... rene ...
no wonder he was angry .
shit , i started to get worried . where the fuck ya been ?
when'd you see him last ?
i'm not sure , exactly . i had monsters on the brain . i wanted to get these guys , every one of them . i got obsessive .
yeah .
soran doesn't care about power or weapons . all he cares about is getting back to the nexus .
eh -
lighting co@@ gh@@ ill ' 5 cigar : our good colonel du@@ m@@ ford scored quite a coup with the si@@ kali horse .
yeh , that's bull . i'm going for serene , they say some actually get there .
yes .
i got a new car . only it's red . did you know mama died ?
we do favors for each other ...
she was raped . at least that's what she claimed .
you tell her , max . come on , do her that favor . tell her there isn't going to be any picture - - there aren't any fan letters , except the ones you write yourself .
... it .
very interesting . i'm learning a lot about manure . what's that ?
i don't think you're being fair , sir . you assigned me this guy , and you know he's got a history ...
of course , nick ...

what do you mean ?
it was clarendon . he knew i had the gun in my bag .
maybe . can't really tell yet .
i don't want a bodyguard . i want the man i fell in love with .
i'll be okay .
i thought you were watching him .
but you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious , do you ?
i see .
i'm with an old friend now , dmitri .
it's okay . it's alright .
maybe you should sleep with the judge too . then we can win the case .
enough . cut him loose .
you have a lot of brothers and sisters ?
well , maybe they thought you'd need another one . maybe they thought ...
i know a guy in the justice department who was around the grand jury .
it's locked on the inside . it's through that passageway and to the right .
that's ... good ?
well , the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it ! you're lucky you don't remember the revolution - - i never had much , but what i did have - - i lost .
i do not marry tonight .
it's all i could afford .
yes .
of course . we never left the air . i know - i didn't sleep the whole night long .
you do ?
any idea what he did ?
her who ?
you do see me standing here , right ?
that's the rumor on the street .
well ... you're looking well .
is anyone there ?
my goodness , a word with four sy@@ lla@@ bles . i should get some ice before your brain gets too hot .
how's the pain ?
nobody leaves .
well , uh ... you're what grammy hall would call a real jew .
t@@ would appear other travelers pre@@ ce@@ de us .
how did i end up at the third rate ch@@ it@@ t@@ lin ' circuit greasy hole in the wall in west hell , vi@@ r@@ gin@@ ny ? is that what you're asking ya daddy ?
you're here quite a bit , then .
what happened on the charges ?
home , school , here ...

i think i'm starting to wear her down . have some anyway .
there sure is ! i'm going to tell you somethin ' ... i wasn't going to speak of it ... but i'll tell you now . did you notice them scal@@ ps strung on scar's lance ? did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance ? long ... wa@@ vy hair ...

yes , sir . what is wrong ?
no , i saw a guy shooting from over there . he was behind that fence . what are you going to do about it ?
i've always loved your playing , mr . szpilman .
<i> fiji . </i>

prison ?
yeah .
hello ?
home after . will you come in and say " hi " ?
such a brief visit , but dear child , it has made my christmas very merry .
i don't think i could , but we could try .
checking out a theory . just keep talking to him .
i guess i see the tea@@ cup as a symbol for wo@@ manhood , because of tea parties in the o@@ l@@ d@@ en days , but instead of tea i was trying to kind of confront people with this ... like ...
now i'm going to ask you to do me a favor , and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day . okay ?
have the police got any idea where wynant is ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
nobody touches me .
yes .
nobody lives within twenty-five miles , ' cept some old couple who live right on the lake . teenagers tre@@ k in every once in a while , none have disappeared , and none have spotted anything unusual .
here !
i'm sorry for losing it back there , but you must remember , sister , you have vows to god as well as a mission to the world .
if you like . but don't be too modest , james . the c@@ iti@@ z@@ en's duty is to remember , not necessarily to write books . you are highly qualified . you're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job . every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history . a genuine ty@@ ran@@ ny would have to get rid of people like you .
i tell you every damned place i go the man is ad@@ ored ! " general washington ! champion of trenton ! savior of the republic ! " and you should hear the way people are depre@@ ca@@ ting congress !
i though we went over this .
y@@ it@@ z@@ cha@@ k , they told me you had influence .
ahh , that little chevy was your mothers favorite car .
you're going to three-four avenue c , 17 year-old female cardiac arrest , no further information .
stro@@ lls right back into a crime scene . who would do such a thing ? how do you defend against it ?
said " looks clear . "
don't be smart .
how was that ?
i love you , danny . i love you more than anything else in the whole world , and i'd never do anything to hurt you , never ... you know that , don't you , huh ?
how long you gonna be , bill ?
how would you go about applying the golden rule , earl ?
mr rothstein ... i'm pat webb .
no , not louis !
well , mr . fazeli , the bowling congress says i'm a thorn in their side .
i knowed you'd be here . what are you a-@@ doin ' digging with that sto@@ b ?
these are beautiful . how's the case coming ?
zorro . yes , ran it through my files , even asked around : came up completely blank . thought there might be a mexico connection , el paso and all , but nothing . fooled around with the letter " z , " turned it on it's side , got " n " - - there ng , he's vietnamese . the only thing that came to mind was zero , not zorro . remember suspect zero ?
they're not looking for him .
not for years .
really ? perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instru@@ ction ?
shame . i was recommended . by a friend .
sure , as soon as we eat .
by reputation . he got ann rum@@ sey that cute little island of george's .
no .
you're goin ' if the captain says you're goin ' ...
carl somethin ' ?
plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night ...
there ... it seems to quit ... i'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing .
i've watched you once or twice . you surf like it's some kind of street fight . you jerk along from moment to moment , fighting everything that comes at you . always trying to win .
hop in , marty , . we've got a long drive ahead of us .
yeah . or the week after .
oh bubba , think of the possibilities .
harold !
why ?
what would you say if i told you that you were going to the homecoming dance tomorrow night ?
came up here - - had hy@@ ster@@ i@@ cs and passed out . i've been trying to get her to come to .
can it truly be used for magic ?
i understand that . i just thought that you might want to know .
my girl back home . we're supposed to get married after i get my wings . she was tommy's girl . they were engaged to be married before he died . i should've told you about her . i don't know why i didn't , except i didn't want you to think i was a shit for making it with lynette .
i can't , hoss . i don't talk to fbi's .
the rules are the rules .
i've called the hospital ; they've notified consiglere gen@@ co's family to come and wait . he won't last out the night .
or al@@ ber@@ tus ma@@ gn@@ us . cornelius ag@@ ri@@ ppa ...
chinese pe@@ on@@ y root .
we need light in here , stat .
does alyssa know ?
look at the stars .
how'd you know ?
you're a good sport , lady .
come on - - let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear .
they would have killed you -
under a cloud without cause , i take it .
it's open-@@ house . no crashing involved . anybody in the ho@@ te@@ l's welcome .
you made a choice once . do you think you would make that same choice again ?
don't put yourself down like that . i <u> never </u> used you . i worked my way up like a marine grunt !
you know about this stuff ?
she was a nurse . she must've lived near there , somewhere , near the ... ... the clinic . there must be some registry of nurses or medical techni@@ ci@@ ans or whatever for wyoming .
yeah .
at least it's nothing contagious .
shoot ! ! !
next , please .
mary !
saw the sign outside . got your own sign , huh ?
hah ! ... tell me the truth , eve - if i wait until i feel better , will i ever meet the man ?
i just hate to see you p@@ in@@ ing away . it makes me want to vomit , frankly . broken hearts are for assholes .
long time .
junebug , that is a tough , tough thing to do . probably tougher than you can understand right now .
what ?
but what about all these other people ?
hello , can i have room 5@@ 60@@ 1 .
i can't tonight .
that's what respectable folks do . get a job , get married , start having babies . that's what you want , isn't it ?
yeah .
no . what you do today ?
let's talk after dinner . stay and eat .
darling !
hi .
i'll open mine , too .
that's the first question to answer , if we're going to find them .
roger that , north island . arctic warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two . over and out .
con@@ vul@@ sion ?
i recognize you only as my son , no more .
what's that supposed to mean ?
no no , no more advice on how to patch it up tom . you just help me win . understood ?
it's too involved ; a lifetime of non - involvement . anywhere else i'd be an interesting little number , here i'm just sag number forty-eight thousand and one . sag meaning screen act@@ or's guild .
why not ?
you're in quite a mood today .
she's in a kind of shock . i see all the signs of a post-@@ traumatic reaction with possible dis@@ soci@@ ative symptoms .
what's wrong , trash ?
in other words , i'm on trial .
is that something precious ?
louder . they can't hear you .
then the department of justice owns 100 % of bialystock and bloom .
dra@@ g@@ line gives out the names here . you'll get yours when he figures you out .
sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country , all these hippies running around on drugs , the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore . i saw a girl the other day , she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly , and you know what she painted on it ? " love child . " it's fuckin ' outa control . val@@ u@@ es@@ 've gone to hell , jim ... course it figures when you got somebody like that po@@ le@@ cat johnson in the white house .
you're out of your depth , tra@@ u@@ t@@ man . way out . i'm acting correctly here . not you . not your gung-ho jungle ace . it's over . walk away .
yes . i've - - i've met some very remarkable people in india ... and - - and when i read what you've been doing here , i - - i wanted to help . does that surprise you ?
bring some ice cream , i'm burning up . do you love me ?
i feel fine .
switch the charts .
yes , sir ...
eight o'clock ! why , that's twelve hours !
you think we should be more open minded ?
but even if you were in love with me .
your honor , this is a tape from miss law@@ son's answering machine . i would like to play it now .
peculiar ? you mean , like back then ?
oh my , no !
where up north ?
until dallas , we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism . that mass infection would make us a slave race .
my mother sent you a letter ? what's it say ?
you're looking at him . we provide the plane , transportation cost , u . s . landing spot , and take it to wherever you want it to go . you provide the pick up point in south america , and are responsible for payment . you assume all the bust risks . we take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees , ten percent of the gross , plus our expenses . this is not a negotiation , so if this is okay with you , we can talk further . if not , we can forget we had this conversation .
who's this .
sure .
shit and fried eggs .
yeah .
like what ?
what does snow think you should do ?
is there no way they can get back to you ?
i calculate that's the end of this town . and let's don't bother about the luggage , darling .
you don't want me , sugar - i'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-@@ good@@ ni@@ cks you've been running away from -
my present ?
he gets to be the hero .

when i asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances , they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth , in their presence , at their coun@@ tin@@ g-@@ house in bir@@ chin lane , london . i requested they come here , and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to london , but they de@@ clin@@ ed , saying that they did not wish to in@@ cu@@ r the risk of a visit to castle hack@@ ton to negotiate , as they were aware of how other respectable parties , such as me@@ ss@@ rs . sharp and sa@@ lo@@ mon had been treated here .
my love is no lie . i have a wife , yes , and i cannot marry the daughter of sir robert de les@@ se@@ ps . it needed no wife come from stratford to tell you that . and yet you let me come to your bed .
yes .
i guess there's probably a story behind that .
i'm just borrowing some clean clothes . i'm not staying .
ever seen one that starts at the top ? 20 stories worth of top ?
i am not here , ol ' buddy . the cia has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship , the missing gold , where it was going , or when it left hong kong .

thank you , sir .
childs , where's that magneto from chopper one ?
if ever i need a boss , joe .
it's me .
because of your phone calls .

that's all they're interested in - it's a freak show to them . i can't control it , sal - let'em say what they want . forget it . it don't matter .

kkinsa , cru@@ tch is hurt ! we need access to the shu@@ tt@@ le's me@@ d-@@ kit or he'll die .
you find something curious in that ?
i don't know what to think , marlon . maybe i'm going out of my mind , but i get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow .
he's my father , millie .
right .
fish are all over the water ... come on , let us take a boat out .
so , maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet . maybe there's something in there that might help us . maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around .
and ... ?
how we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life , wouldn't you say ?
the lon@@ gh@@ or@@ ns gonna kick some serious butt this saturday , you just watch . we got a kid at ta@@ il@@ back from down your way--@@ outta el indi@@ o - -

oh . my . god . i can't believe you're here . welcome . can i just tell you , i am so excited right now .
you don't mean that .
ugh .
jerking off ?
makes a lot more sense than ... well , an attack .
i'm just saying .
nothing happened .
i'm taking a reme@@ dial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards .
my father always said to me , ' son , don't invest your money in anything but land . land ! stocks rise and fall , banks fall , people are no damn good , but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose . ' remember that , ' my father said . ' land . "
fifteen .
we gave so much to get here . i don't know . sometimes i think what the hell did we do it for ?
i appreciate your cooperation . i'm looking for a missing girl ... ... this girl here , denise willis ... have you seen her ?

george , are you sure of the porters ? about their taking care of you , i mean ?
took no chances , did he ? and when you got there , he pushed her off the tower , was that it ? but you were the one who screamed . why did you scream ?
you're crazy ! you're really out of your mind !
do you think i should stop by on my way back ? show you what i got ? it's not a problem .
which language ?
you're not gonna be there .
i knew you'd listen to reason !
this is a lifestyles hotel .
well ... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called , what's her name ?

<u> hey watch it </u> !
what's furry , furry rabbit ?
if we could sell tickets , we'd make a fortune .

shot down , forced down ... you guys are <u> missing </u> it ... you're missing the <u> opportunity </u>
oh , i will ! your very trust has in@@ sti@@ lled an enormous sense of responsibility in me . i don't want to disappoint you .
i think the best thing to do with broussard is to just freeze him as he is . it'll arrest the progress of his disease , and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the colonies .
... a sol@@ da@@ do , he takes care of it .
that's a nice name . ok , let me see it .
why ?
that's right , sir - - i come from new orleans - - i was raised to be a sau@@ ci@@ ere .. a great sau@@ ci@@ ere . we speci@@ alize in sau@@ ces ; my whole family . it's what we do . i was supposed to go to paris and study at the e@@ sco@@ f@@ fi@@ er school ; i was saving the money . they called me for my physical so i figured the navy had better food .
okay , fella . but just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me .
look at this , pinkerton ! they got the payroll , and this damage will set construction back two months at least .
back you up ? now why would i wanna do that ?
no , she'll only reject me in the end and i'll be frustrated .
i changed the conditions of the test . i received a commen@@ dation for original thinking . i don't like to lose .

i'll go with that plan .
thanks for dinner . i never saw anybody cook potatoes that way .
very ... so , who you working for these days eric ?
fine . good .

here , take the broom . the front needs sweeping .
they're waiting to see my father .
what about my neck ?
will you tell the gentleman i'm not in ?
i see . the men . you'll strike , maybe , for your demands - - but what the wives want , that comes later , always later .
where are you going ?
yah .
alex .
this is crazy . we don't have time for this .
mike , it would be like trying to kill the president ; there's no way we can get to him .
cut it out , ma , or i'll - -
mama , no .

the wind isn't blowing .
we pretend ...
the short one with black hair is your cousin irene - -

no .
thank you , your majesty .

therefore , i shall ignore you .
and living out here , in this rest home asylum , that's what you want ?
' cause if you say another word , i'm gonna fuck@@ n ' kill ya !
isn't the four seasons a little far uptown ? i mean aren't you going to be late ?
that's what i always say .
that's your decision .
do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in .
look at these guys .
huh ?
i wanna see that guy !
sure , it's a blast , but listen , i sorta screwed up my knee yesterday - -
your men knew the risks .
we've only seen and talked to one suspect . he calls himself " joe " . there's two je@@ wel@@ ers , two sa@@ les@@ people , the manager , a security guard , and an elderly woman . this particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair . they have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day , so they sure as shit didn't just wander in . they knew what they were coming for .
thank you , muffy . funny thing is : this is an important element of , " seduce and de@@ story : " " facing the past is an important way in not making progress , " that's something i tell my men over and over - -
you're right . it's your version . you should come over to the studio sometime .
this is another victory , my friends . what began with the la@@ sh shall be concluded with a care@@ ss .
grace , tell him .
gino travels with a big man named roy . caesar calls him the driver .
i guess i'm used to it . i've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back .
it's always politics . like this thing we're in here , he's paying you to tune me up , right ? but i could pay you more not to . see what i mean ? i could write you a check right now - -
yeah ...
i think you do . but i thank god we all don't .
i wasn't sure if you'd make it .
yeah .
alan was not ... un@@ balanced when i married him . and he was not ... ' in@@ different to women ' no matter what they said ! hunsecker i'm not fighting with you , puss ...
oh ...
i don't think we can do that .
some other time , cobb . some other time .
what assistant ?
what kind of nuts ?
no way .
shhh . he'll hear you .
they'll learn to live with it .
sir ?
yes . but - - that was the other night . now - - i don't think i would .
oh , i'm sorry .
you think i'm lying ?
suppose lake michigan over@@ flows ?
it's no big deal , it just <u> looks </u> better carrying me . oh , you mean because i wasn't carrying my purse at the time .
read it . bruce and har@@ ri@@ e@@ tt ny@@ borg . what happened here ?
i thought you wanted to buy spe@@ c@@ ta@@ cles an ' fancy clothes an ' all .

claudia , let's get married ?

but you was going to fight for me .
enjoying the tour so far ?
really . he has a cop's face .
mistake ?
this administration does not negotiate with terrorists .
yeah , sure . look what happened to them .
not really .
he'd kill me . he'd be right to kill me , too@@ --the kind of guy he is .
i came back to help you . you said do i let girls sneak into my house . you know where i live . if you need to , come to where i live , ok ?
i thought you could give us the tour this morning . sort of be our indian guide .
you mean he's not a criminal ?
do you think juliet could stay here while her parents are away ?
not at all . you have your life . and i have mine .
sure . you could probably have any thing you wanted ... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself , and you don't even realize it .
yeah ... funny really , ' cos i'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time , doesn't it ?
claude .
john ! i'm so glad to see you . ii was terribly worried .
look what i found . remember these ?
i need you .
can i go home and work this out and let you know ? in a week or so ?
don't move .
this whole idea - - this date and everything . it was my parents ' idea . they forced me into it .
someone should stand up and strike back .
i wish i knew what you think i know .
lloyd , it's us .
moneypenny ! how indiscreet ! have you ever known me to kiss and tell ?
what are you doing ?
give - - me - - your - - hand !
i'll bet .
good for you .
you had your coaches and your father for that stuff . it never mattered one way or the other if i went to your games .
did you ever go i one ?
you knew the subject thomas grunemann . how well ?
ch-@@ charlie m !
dennis !
let's get you dried off first . i might have some clothes below .
i'm a whiskey man myself . we don't have much trouble from drugs where i come from ...
we took all the chances . the money belongs to us , not him !
you got your riot gun ?
nice to meet you . if you don't mind me asking you - how old are you ?
of course .
i can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated , to be destroyed ...
does it feel comfortable ?
yeah , old times .
leon , i want to tell you something which i thought i never would say , which i thought nobody ever should say , because i thought it didn't exist ... and , leon ... i can't say it ...
the hostages ... ?
so i want you to keep a clear head .
hello , denby !
but no intention of selling them . one would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him , money would .
yep .
thank you , your honor . further : ms . costello is a rebuttal witness . as a ` surprise witness ' she may only serve to re@@ but direct testimony . as her only evi@@ den@@ ti@@ ary rebuttal was the admitting form , which has been disallowed i request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here .
no , i'm going to answer you . you want an answer ? i'll give it to you . loyalty . she was loyal . everything grew from there .
ok . claudia wilson : you tryin ' to go deaf ?
get to know them . very well . your job and my job depends on it .
is that why the two of you went through my du@@ ff@@ le@@ bag ?
tell me , why this sudden desire to publish to a@@ wa@@ ken like by@@ ron and find yourself famous .
no , straight up .
so he could have decided to go on a trip ...
then c'mere . i got something for you .
in case you get back before i do .
oh , that's nice .
i saw the way he looked at you . the way he kissed you .
how does it work ?
no , thank you . i'll be all right .
randolph !
saving your life .
you've sacrificed ? ! if you'd practice law for decent folk instead of communists and indi@@ gents - -
no .
nothing ... i should never have left him ...
that's the first question to answer , if we're going to find them .
you'd better talk , schulz , because i'm going to find out with you or without you . because i won't let go for a second . because they'll have to kill me to stop me . so talk !
sound it out for me .
do you <u> believe </u> ... i have forgotten i am a cop ?
i could smell another woman on him .
what business ?
yes , a name for the operation .
you talked to your supervisor lately ? he's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight . that on top of the cops bugging him .
did what ?
benjamin , is this your first time ?
yeah , in this book there's a chapter called self made freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show . it mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of bor@@ neo and shit like that , but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-@@ less wonder .
he's a lawyer . please , sit , here ...
there's a squ@@ all in there that's sha@@ pin ' up into a storm .
with respect , sir , many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes . maybe he's just unlucky .
hey , relax man , i'm a brother sha@@ mus .
we'd never make it . they're probably all over the road .
i can't believe it a small fortune . you can't buy me you're still a bum ! ' bye , edie . lord have mercy on joey .
how long have you been setting up ?
not with this disk . i'm going to check on the beam connection , yori . you two can keep a watch out for grid bugs .
i apologize .
well , water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures ... not even for pictures of dolphins ...
anyway ... i did my time on door@@ -to-@@ doors , and walking a beat . i did all that shit for a long time .
no , jesse , your problem is you're always doing stuff before i'm finished figuring it out .
lloyd .
did you watch " i dream of je@@ annie ? "
i'd be very careful if i were you . you don ' t want to fall into the clu@@ tches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain .
wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find ?
working at wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths .
i know i am . i know !
not necessarily ...
you make videos ?
got one ready , sir . subway . state and bal@@ bo .
look , it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy ?
m@@ ct@@ ea@@ gue .
right standard ru@@ dder , z plus five degrees ...
okay , get your clothes on . i got the cab downstairs .
i got it all ready . here .
they're fantastic .
nervous ?

i'm here for an interrogation . you've been called a graffiti artist and i wanna know why . all i see are scribble scrabble ab@@ stra@@ ctions !
that's okay , rok .
i'm in california most of the time . traveling a lot on business . that's about it , really .
just stay right fuckin ' here , all right ?
you do a lot of real estate trading , brandon ?
cameron - - do you like the girl ?
you got two counts against you - - trapping out of season and po@@ a@@ ching on restricted land .
do you think if i went with you this wizard would give me some brains ?
thank you for keeping me informed .
well , the guard woke me up . he told me i volunteered .
you're naked .
i'll just have to try harder . i don't know . i will . i will . i will . i will .
what's the point ?
you are going to marry my brother ?
what is that he's working on ?
we must escape . we have plans . we can leave . we must wait until ...
i'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here .
so am i .
it's a full moon , ' beware the moon ' .
was it me , did you have something against me ?
i didn't do it . i didn't do it .
you're an outsider , mr . desmond . step aside ; stay out of it .
uh , huh huh , this fat dude . he said we could do you . and he was gonna pay us .
i don't know . they must think i look like this guy gladstone .
seriously .
good night walter .
i know , and next to that is the police , hospital , fire , and probably national guard .
i don't have much time . they don't even need bugs anymore . they got these fuckin ' satellite waves . they put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born , right up his nostrils , sub@@ cu@@ tan@@ e@@ ous , between his eyes . he was one of those products of a cross@@ brea@@ ding experiment . a nazi rocket scientist father and a commie spy mother . you'd never believe half the shit the agency does . i'm so fuckin ' tired . haven't slept since that shit article came out . why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this ?
i see .
i thought only hookers drank those things .
well , you know , i-i-i ... you know , if you want me to , i'll read it .
sure will , pal , sure will .
i guess i owe you a debt of gratitude . you saved my life .
i remember a pair of young philosophers once , who laughed at the world .
no idea . honest . what are you going to do ?
fine , fine , at a later date , i'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological comple@@ x@@ ities with the one who's not the creep . but for now , i'm drilling inside your brains ... i bring up the whole catwoman thing for one reason . i bit captain god in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big ban@@ da@@ ids and wobbly excuses - - " my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender .. "
i thought i told you to get lost .
what !
the order of sea@@ ting at the upper ser@@ van@@ t's table is arranged personally by the queen herself .
phasers on stun . move out .
i've got to talk to you .
yeah ! ! i talked to andy kaufman !
can't make enough swords !
tomorrow morning . start hit@@ ch-@@ hiking right away and ...

yes , sir .
yes .
i don't know if you heard . a hired gun@@ man tried to off adrian .
just a general way .
of course not .
no , it was wonderful . that wasn't the problem .
it's her baby too , you know .
what , do you like it here ?
you're not carrying a bull@@ whip ... how'd you manage to put my kids to work ?
nothing on ' em and two cups of mud ; one while i'm waiting .
you driving her ?
go back to the drawing board .
sort of .
go .
that explains it . i'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the militia are getting ready to storm the hotel .
he chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot .
used to filmore , used to .
witch .
' s all right , kid . i took care of ' em myself this morning .
but nobody had to take care of nicky .
i don't know . when i was in college , i was forced to go to a psychiatrist because i was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor .
... yeah , but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into ...
something . to pay them back . someone , someone should hurt them . murray and mitch .
yeah , you betcha .
elaine , i'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago .
howdy , mr . grant . you goin ' to the deer cheer this weekend ?
no , no , no , no . you can't take him away now . this is his night . won't you introduce us , wolfgang ?
jeez , louise , that wasn't very nice .
ah , doctors . what's he gonna tell me ? can't trade my head in for a new one .
well , james , you did shoot the head of the english department's dog and steal his most pri@@ zed piece of memor@@ ab@@ i@@ lia .
stick around and you'll see .
i'm sorry . i was looking for maude .
this was not my idea .
sometimes , yes .
i don't know what i'm saying . maybe - - maybe they hired those guys .
this doesn't look like the kind of place betty would go to .
more than prince of cats . he is the courageous captain of compliments . he fights as you sing prick - song , keeps time , distance , and proportion ; he rests his min@@ im rest , one , two , and the third in your bosom : the very butcher of a silk button , a du@@ el@@ list , a du@@ el@@ list ; a gentleman of the very first house , of the first and second cause : the immortal pa@@ ssa@@ do ! pun@@ to rever@@ so ! the ha@@ i !
looked like an interview to me .
how can you be sure ?
i am tom green , i am tom green . daddy want some sausage , sausage . daddy want some sausage ...
i - ran away ...
i'm just warning you , i can't swim .
i don't think that'll happen .
we gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time .
are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the ho@@ ts for me ?
they say it hit both sides of his brain ... even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable .
you haven't driven in 40 years , you ain't even got a license . man's taking his life in his hands , putting you behind the wheel ! where you taking him ?
what is your husband's profession ?
maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation . it's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for . it's worse that we don't know where it is . and now this . this was supposed to be my last job . i already put the deposit down on my boat . how can you eat at a time like this ? i get nauseous just watching you ...
i found it ! i found it !
are you finished with me ?
well , you never know , do you ?
he is my sponsor . the general is the head of the secret police of honduras .
what's this ?
all right , suppose i am a mutant ? why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic ?
and there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-@@ strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you !
hope so . those fucking or@@ tho@@ don@@ ti@@ st bills are killing me . one fifty every time they tighten those bitches up . one fifty ! it's not even covered .
fall , six months at the earliest .
oh , things aren't so bad . gee , i hope you're not goin ' to get in any trouble .

i need very little sleep . we must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange . i have already started a survey of our most urgent needs .
you told that thi@@ ev@@ in ' little shit where we were goin ' ? !
i don't care about the rest of the world !
okay , if that's what it takes , you'll never have to see me again . here ... here ...
i can't sleep nights .
one thing at a time , laz .
ellen , would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
i've heard good things about their london branch . you have to admit , it sounds like some fantasy , ro@@ le-@@ playing nonsense .
yeah , that's fascinating , but i'm just a fat , dumb cop lookin ' for a psycho killer - -
when you're hot , you're hot .
you telling me what to do , roderick ?
wait , eve , please ! wait .
you never were together , hal .
we performed on the beach one summer ... ha ... everything went wrong .

tom ...
it's hard . we started going to a marriage counselor .
a bum . look what you're doing . you want to be brave ? firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave . any bum who picks up a . 45 in a pawn shop can be that brave . you want to hurt johnny friendly ? you want to fix him for what he did to charley and a dozen men who were better than charley ? don't fight him like a ho@@ od@@ lum down here in the jungle . that's just what he wants . he'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense . fight him tomorrow in the courtroom with the truth as you know it truth is the gun drop that thing and tell the truth a more dangerous weapon than this little cap pistol .
just five . it's the economy ... you think maybe one of them is not who they seem ?
have you ever read any anna a@@ k@@ h@@ ma@@ to@@ va ?
and we would hear them scu@@ tt@@ ling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-@@ t - teeth and i'm just imagining plague li@@ ce jump@@ in ' all over the damn place so we set t-t-@@ traps everywhere . and every morning we would find the t-t-@@ traps sprung but no mice !
no shit . you got someplace in mind ?
of course there weren't . ' cause they disappeared . and yet the commission found you , dean .
let's talk about the work that you care so much about .
that a fact . now , is it a good play ?
here they are again . look at ' em .
no . it's not .
how much .
wayne , if it was anybody else - - -
promise not to tell doll ? - - or nobody ? buddy , it's your daddy ! i'm so much in love with him i am out of my mind !
well damn it . i don't speak ill of the dead . what i'm trying to say is , its was just a crazy accident . the exact same thing could have happened if he was with me . you can't go beating yourself up about it .
a lot of cakes .
if she were a true blonde , she would've left the cheating bastard . blondes don't let their husbands get fe@@ lla@@ ted by brunettes and live to tell about it .
don't know where she got " marie , " but " sa@@ mu@@ els " figures . her boy friend's name is sam . was she in disguise ? or do you want to check the picture again ?
you wanna see if he has more shells , go ahead . i say we wait ...
oh , please . i get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and i don't see all my kids here .
these guys are incredibly persistent .
shhh . shhh .
whose funeral ? we're doing all right . there hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days .
i'm having a blast . god , that sucker te@@ ed off on it just like he knew i was gonna throw a fastball .
i love this air . this is wonderful air .
they're nervous , sire .
doesn't want you thinking too much , huh ?
not in the nineties .
i told you , i quit .
wyatt , i ... i ain't got the words .
oh , she'd quickly rever@@ t in her appearance to her actual age .
that's mighty black of you .
i can't help the traffic .
sir ?
i'd rather spit in your face . but as i haven't got any spit ...
where - - ?
i am sir lancelot of the lake , from across the sea . i am the best knight in the whole of ch@@ ri@@ sti@@ an@@ dom , and i look for the king who is worthy of my s@@ word's service .
like what ?
i'll schedule the launch . call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew .
look , you put me on this boat in the first place . i didn't want to come but i did . why do you have to embarrass me . why can't you just leave me alone ?
alright , suit yourself .
who brought you here ?
this is just about money , you know that .
of course .
that's exactly what he says about you .
it happened to you before ?
i was up on the roof this morning , tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has . that i'm happy today .
what did you wish for , honey ?
what are you talking about ?
well , i'll call him when he does .
most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down .
thirty meters or so . moving slow , but straight toward el@@ sie .
you gotta plan these things .
relax , this guy owes me a big one . a couple years ago he got in a jam up in the boston office ; some bullshit about padding his resume - - like we haven't all done that . anyway , they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear@@ -@@ jerker letter that ended up on my desk .
if i didn't i wouldn't be here ! i've got it all ite@@ mi@@ zed .
jesus , first mars , now you . you two need anti-@@ depre@@ ss@@ ants .
why , thank you .
may as well go out under my own free will , right ?
and who are you ?
aye , sir .
i'll keep my eyeballs peeled .
tell me about it , please !
everybody has a story , skip .
i came here from a long distance to stay at the grand hotel . i want a room - - a big room - - like you would give general director preysing - - i'm as good as mr . preysing - - i can pay like mr . preysing - - would you give him a little room , way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going - - bang - - bang - - bang ...
wait a second .
it does not .
... i need to sit down .
luther , i'm looking at security .
that's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on ? re@@ pressing your real self ?
we'll find out now , won't we ?
it's grand !
the mamma's there too .
but i don't play anything .
so far only their scouts . but we have had reports of a small imp@@ i farther north , over there .
that is a marvelous image , walter . because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around .
you owe wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars .
what'll happen to us , nell ?
only if we ask him .
i happen to know so .
maybe .
i can't believe they still ate it .
you don't know who the fuck - -
it was <u> free </u> - - i recall that was the chief selling point for you .
still needs work .
what ?
un-@@ fucking-@@ believable . dick's out on a hot date , rob's boning marie la@@ sa@@ lle , and the best-@@ looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all .
that's it folks for the demon boat ride ... everybody off . watch your hands and feet .
you shut up , this is the most fucked up mission i ever heard of . goddamned ryan , fuck the little bastard .

never mind , fred ...
general lee , sir !
so ?

i don't wanna kill anybody . but if i gotta get out that door , and you're standing in my way , one way of the other , you're gettin ' outta my way .
my name is die@@ dri@@ ck@@ son . county medical examiner .
me , too . parts of the bible are great .
john , we - - what i'm just saying ...
but i never saw that note ! i must have covered it with my hand , without realizing it , that's the only explanation ...
then we cannot go .
what's your specialty ?
is that yours ?
false .
are you staying with a friend , sir ?
' kay ...
are you wearing eye shadow ?
why does it all mean so much to you ? all the time , ' land , land , land . '
well , i've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic .
taking it seriously .
but the code is made up by general ripper , and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code .
men can touch other men , and it doesn't mean a thing . haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the superbowl ?
what are you doing ?
mr . appleton , please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the " bread instead of bullets club ? "
no , not people - - just deer and game , but the people he catches can never be free again . they too must kill and kill , covering themselves with blood .
no , dr . grant says ...
just something i'm trying .
winning is easy . losing is complicated . it's a life@@ time's work .
to hear them read torah .
well , if i go back on my word , i'll kill her .
no .
i'm not hungry . you two just enjoy yourselves . after all , this is a celebration .
yes , mr . gittes .
why did he come to you ?
oh regan i love your daddy . i'll always love your daddy . burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely , don't got nothin ' to do .
sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do . it's all part of growing up . and it usually works out peachy in the end .
... i'm sorry .
how many points you got left on your license ?
i never make plans that far ahead .

no ... tell me .
we didn't do nothin ' special i can remember . just talked , is all .

he knows somebody ratted him .
heidi , i'm dying .
i've loved you ever since i can remember , long before you married tom dickson .
all right rachel , you stay by this radio . the state boys will send word once their in route . when that word comes you go tell deputy logan .
i'm really afraid .
i will . when can i come visit ?
yes , yes , i understand .
we did for a long time . we just got married too young , and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things .
i did ? what do i tell a source on the next tough story ? hang in with us . you'll be fine ... maybe ?
i will .
which bathroom is that , sir ?
but where would we go ?
well , i try and talk to him , but mostly he's the one who does the talking .
damn skippy . he like it , too .
i can do it , captain .
do that .
he was here last night till about two o'clock . i hear you really got stuck with a dog last night .
he builds models for architects . his dad , on the other hand , was the real deal . designed and built the coolest houses i've ever seen .
peter , okay ?
a leech on the welfare state in addition . you don't miss a trick .
oh , baby . what a bad boy you are !

an angel , when she was having one of her headaches .

but i don't mind telling you , i'm awful pleased my ad@@ ven@@ tur@@ ing days is at an end ...
only he wasn't carryin ' no pistol this time .
no . there is another chip .
why , it's a man ! a man made out of tin !

give who a tail ?
where did you hear that name ?
you needn't worry . it's over and done with . a long time ago .
we'll see about adjusting the do@@ sage if that doesn't clear in the next how are other things going ?
me sir ?
how did you guess ?
beats me . he just asked me to come along , double-@@ check the forensics . what did you do to piss him off ?
is he all right ? is he all right ?
hey ! turn that float around . you think a swan@@ 's gonna swim ass first up main street ?
if that was your knife , muddy , i wanna thank you for givin ' it to her - - no girl should be goin ' * hit@@ ch-@@ hi@@ kin ' * if she don't got a good knife with her .
see ya tomorrow .
you want my partner to kiss your ass ?
a friend of mine tried one of their " special offers " ... nearly got himself lo@@ bo@@ to@@ mi@@ zed .

i think that's how it's getting oxygen to him .
the reactor .
meurice ...
with lots of ketchup ?
you were a soldier , and then a gladiator , weren't you ?
i could get a search warrant .

i'm not gonna mention ricky to him .
but you're always at the library .
oh !

i'm trying , i can't find a canadian ser@@ ver ... i've got to break into the main frame ...
see you , ginger .

your father and i were very close . of course jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends ... especially after the bombing and i keep his name alive at the office every day .
yes , sir . here is my letter .
leave that one lay .
don't see generosity much these days . everything always got a catch . guess i'm tryin ' to say ... thank you .
christoph was a brilliant pro@@ gra@@ mm@@ er , but very eccentric . he insisted it be kept vacant .

i assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating i plan to give your cadets .
anything ... you call us right away . you got that ?
i don't know . something's missing .
so i got talent . so what beat me ?
not in that way ; you're always looking for company .
i'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-@@ wives , dear boy - they'll be interested to hear that .
don't look at the cost , look at what it brings . what is your last offer ?
yes , that's perfectly correct .
her cleverness , that hard edge - - maybe they're the weakest part of her . the strong part is what's underneath . the part she was protecting . there's no reason to protect it ... i think she's just finding that out now .
yes , your majesty .
tv repair ?
i told him we had to get the u@@ m@@ bi@@ li@@ cal un@@ hooked a@@ sap .
okay , look . my job is not who i am . i don't need that . why ? what's your goal ? status ? money ? getting your picture on the cover of some glo@@ ssy magazine ?

great .
there could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it .
who's brumby ?
hold on .
everything is not fine !
nuthin ' i can't handle .
it's brighter there ... besides , we can't go back .

we were sworn in on the constitution to protect federal matters , ray . i don't know about uranium , i don't know about red dog table - - all i know is we did our job . it's over .
i think we all need a good night's sleep . why don't we meet next week and th@@ rash this thing out ?
i didn't want to kill her .
no , that's all right , i don't mind . i came up here for two reasons . to begin with , i was bored with my job in san francisco . i was teaching at a private school there ... well , you know , you probably went to one yourself .
i'm seeing something that was always hidden . i'm involved in a mystery . i'm learning . and it's all secret .
i don't know ... looks like clothes .
and if that is your so-called " flask , " how would i have it unless i was , in fact , a thief ?
ah , wear whatever you want .
sergeant ? we thought you were ...

her ?
yes . those are our own people . they never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning . it is much too hazardous .
i know but i felt like taking a shift .
close , but no cigar .
shakespeare . he's european .
camelot ...

what about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned italian dinner for my brother , but you wouldn't let her ! ?
huh ?
so tell me , how's it going ?
what's his name ?
look , yesterday wasn't my idea . that was all gale and dollar signs and ratings .
yeah . it certainly is .
maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously .
don't be silly .
when do you need her by ?
what ?
let me get up .
you're over@@ thinking it - -
jerry , there's something i have to ask you . actually about a hundred things , but we can make progress , if you answer one question . to my satisfaction .

huh ?
it'll never happen again . i swear .
drive ? i'm not old enough yet .

so let me get this straight . no airline will claim ownership of the engine . so we have to wait for the fa@@ a to decide who fixes my roof . fuck that . we're taking the money out of savings .
we carried cy@@ ani@@ de cap@@ su@@ les . we were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured . it was your father's opinion that the krauts needed them more than we did at the time .
you sonofabitch !
i don't know , though , i feel so guilty because alvy is paying for it , so , you know , so i do feel guilty if i don't go to bed with him . but if i do go to bed with him , it's like i'm going against my own feelings . i don't know i-i can't win .
sol@@ is said to keep you clear of this .
not at all . captain ren@@ au@@ l@@ t's signature is necessary on every exit visa . captain , would you think it is possible that herr laszlo will receive a visa ?

ill just check into a hotel .
hello ? is this me ? i'm trip . am i on the air ?
ha ... no , mr lombard . his monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us . he knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate .
it was with this sword that my late father , harry james , god rest his soul , met sir hud@@ del@@ stone fu@@ d@@ del@@ stone , the hampshire bar@@ on@@ et , and was fa@@ ta@@ lly run through the neck . he was quite in the wrong , having insulted lady fu@@ d@@ del@@ stone , when in liquor , at the bren@@ t@@ ford assembly . but , like a gentleman , he sc@@ or@@ ned to apologize .

it's not that .
what are you going that way for ?
what about ray ?
you'll work it out , scotty . and remember : two of them .

before he started to run . he said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck@@ --and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door .
i'm sorry about rachel .
give me that . now , listen to me , mister , i don't know what you think you're doing , but demo@@ li@@ shing a building doesn't fall under the definition of ' help ' ! there's hundreds of people out here and you covered half of them in pieces of glass - -

it changed . why ? okay , back over your wrist . because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the ori@@ en@@ tations of the hairs - -
there is no such thing as easy in my experience and , if you think this is going to be easy , you're a dick . it may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy .
you men are all so dreadful !
this is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion .
no . don't be an ass .

anything i can do back here ?
we'll worry about that later . okay , i'll take damage reports .

i'm gonna make love to you . that's what i'm gonna do .
how is my dear friend benjamin feeling ?
that was different .
despite you .
will you paint the damn thing . why do you gotta be such a baby .
i don't need sleep !
and don't open the door for any trick or trea@@ ters even if they come !
can't help it , su@@ ze ... family sticks together ...
you get used to it after a while . now tell me where my money's at .
you better be careful . you'll get a stroke arguing .
i want to stay with you ...
you were meant to you're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to .
but that's absurd . i may not be over-@@ fond of you , steed , but it's not my style .
dear , this is mr . ro@@ ss@@ en , he is the producer ...
yes ... a kiss ... salute !
my mouth - - my mouth !
i saw it . fa@@ ust got himself jammed in the air lock door . his body held it open .

no , you don't , so don't say you do . bunch of damn liars . what do you get out or this ?
you must travel a lot , huh ?

you've all been talking about it ? behind my back ? talking about it ?
if i could trouble the baron to come and see this beautiful room . i have ordered champagne . perhaps the bar@@ on@@ ess could join us .
smoke the rest of that joint , james , and you can start on the box .
yeah , right .

maybe you better just drive me home .
to the bathroom . can i do that alone or do you want to watch ?
uh--@@ cou@@ l@@ d@@ --@@ could i help - - ?
you guys ?
ha ! ha ! now go back .
when carla comes by i'll talk to her . she'll make up some nice invitations . we'll have them printed up .

main interference linked to electronic detector . fight interference on rea@@ di - ness state .
kristen was the last child left of the people who killed freddy . maybe freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me . someone to bring them to him .
m@@ ck@@ en@@ dri@@ ck's men got him .
yes .
excuse me , ladies . i'll just be a moment .
i dont think so , thank you ...
okay , it was bad judgment . but i have the strangest feeling about him - - i've seen him somewhere and ...
like hell it's over . you told me he wasn't doing this anymore .
you're my conscience .
just a little@@ --you know .
you heard that bobby vomit o . d . ' d , right ? do you suspect foul play and stuff ?
a month at most , that's all i ask . elizabeth , please . things have not yet re@@ solved . i must take steps to see that they do . for our family's sake . for our sake . you are life itself . we shall seal our vow . the moment i am done .

if this isn't a re@@ d-@@ letter day for tom dickson ! first i tra@@ mp@@ le on the board of directors , then i promote matt here to assistant cashier , and now to complete the day i have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife . what a man , what a man !
why the fuck would i do that ? i'd be screwing myself .
pa@@ ke@@ e@@ sa ? it's okay . come on . it's okay . come on , they're just joking around .
starting with his own .
yes - - yes - - i am tired . i have been ill ...
your girl friend's name is ralph ?
well i guess we're neighbors for this trip .
if i say yes , will you take your hand away ?
oh ?
sssh ! once and for all , we're in moscow !
i think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this . maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better .
but just think - - the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times ... maybe even just before we left , while i was waiting outside your place ...
what are you doing ? !
he was here ?
maybe it's supposed to end now . maybe god wouldn't have it any other way .
what difference does it make to find an explanation ? that's the way it went . but alfredo didn't betray you , he was the only one who really understood you . salvatore , if you had chosen to be with me , you'd have never made your films . and that would have been a pity ! because they're wonderful , i've seen them all . but you shouldn't have gone and changed your name . you should have kept your own .
come on boys , don't be shy .
yes , i gathered as much .
they might . yes . that's the point ... is that they might ... you see , the jury wants to believe . they're all cy@@ ni@@ cs , sure , because they want to believe . i have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case . i'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve . and every one of them it's written on their face , ' this is a sham . there is no justice ... ' but in their heart they're saying , ' maybe ... maybe ... '
she's gonna kill scotty !
he was a corrupt cop , verbal .
so ?
she does . she says i sleep all day .
what were the yards like ?
talked him out of it . he thinks we're going to stay a week . i'll have to think of something before morning .
yes .
i'm serious . this is how you do it . i'm telling you .
i used to think my bio@@ gra@@ ph@@ y would be jack lucas - the face behind the voice , but now it can be jack lucas , the face " and " the voice ... or maybe just jack - ex@@ cla@@ mation point ...
right , but - - i'm sorry , i don't see why you were cor@@ re@@ sp@@ on@@ ding with pg & e about it in the first place .
why is it a co@@ p-@@ out ? i don't see anythin ' wrong with layin ' brick , that's somebody's home i'm buildin ' . or fixin ' somebody's car , somebody's gonna get to work the next day ' cause of me . there's honor in that .
you okay ?
does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow , or could you hold off for a few days maybe ?
it's too late . all the contracts have been signed , they're almost ready to shoot .
no . i understand perfectly .
what ?
i can have them walk backwards .
don't waste your tears . look at him !
nevertheless .
we don't have anything straightened out . you're uptight about something ... what's wrong ?
i've been looking for a guy - - not one of these south beach pu@@ ssi@@ es .
this is a bad time , henry . i'm busy just now . what do you want ?

it's possible .
so , what about those watergate clowns , john ? this fuck si@@ ri@@ ca@@ 's crazy . thirty-@@ five-@@ year sentences ! there were no weapons . right ? no injuries . there was no success ! it's just ridiculous .

suit up .
so it was " love " .
edna ! come dance with me ! let's be foolish tonight .
what do you mean ?
why not ? i'm not charging you for the time i wasted .
you never wanted to go out with ' me , did you ?
we're fucked . we're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning .
anything .
well you tell him ta take it easy with that . he's gotta learn ta respect women the way connor does .
whyn't you mind your own business , chief .
yes , sir .
what about that girl ?
then call me tomorrow .
oh , i see . you are an actress though , aren't you ?
hackers .
drink ?
beautiful !
it looks pretty hopeless , don't it ?
no !
no , it is . look , over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest , and it's not because you're a space ranger , pal , it's because you're a toy ! you are his toy .
forgive my cru@@ dity , darlin ' . i don't understand these deeper things the way you do .
they crashed it into a wall . a flight simulator .
you're saying it's the same man , but he's changed his style ? that doesn't happen . these men are ro@@ bo@@ tic ; the murder is like a ritual . the method itself is part of the pleasure ...
did you ever touch her ?
it's , uh , it's under twenty-five .
go ahead .
shhhhhh .
yeah . russian minister of transportation .
look , she wasn't a relative , okay ? i don't know who she is .

spock - what are you doing in this neck of the woods ?
i don't know . um ... i'm just an@@ tsy .
here's the overall target area ...
you left your wife ?
all right . speak to you then .
well , that's fine . then you are not insinuating that i am avoiding questions . and i am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report .
what happens if you lose ?
with all the blood i guess they didn't see the rig . guy had it under a wig .
h@@ ru@@ ph@@ h ... ?
well . since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services , could you favour me with a little money instead ?
sidney . hello . how are you ?
i love you .
catherine - - she's a pianist . she's working with carl .
it came from your great , great , great grandmother , i@@ sa@@ belle tou@@ rez , who lived in paris and died on the gu@@ il@@ lo@@ tine in 17@@ 89 - - alone - - and unmarried . the ring was given to her by someone who loved her - - but knew that it could never be .
please , you jump in some guy's face , talk smack and you get a pat on your ass . but because i'm a female , i get told to calm down and act like a " lady " . i'm a ballplayer , okay . a ball player .
they didn't want me when i was born . why should i care ...
it gets , um ... it gets so lonely sometime .
you've got a family tragedy on your hands . will you tell me what's funny about that ? about a kid in a coma ?
letty , dinner's almost ready . the s@@ ou@@ ffle ...
she was hot .
wreck is a harsh term . disturbed is more like it . mildly disturbed even .
i like you .
you even doubt it ? i don't think we got set up , i know we got set up ! i mean really , seriously , where did all those cops come from , huh ? one minute they're not there , the next minute they're there . i didn't hear any sirens . the alarm went off , okay . okay , when an alarm goes off , you got an average of four minutes response time . unless a patrol car is cruising that street , at that particular moment , you got four minutes before they can rea@@ li@@ stically respond . in one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there . all loaded for bear , all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing , and they were all just there ! remember that second wave that showed up in the cars ? those were the ones responding to the alarm . but those other motherfuckers were already there , they were waiting for us . you haven't thought about this ?
annie , some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble .
it could be anything .
lay it on me .
it's easier to lure sharks at night .
we can't . all we can do is guard against our own corruption .
do you remember who gave us this ?
you don't look like you .
why wouldn't we be . i mean , look around . so far so good .
i don't make the distinction . but the sex urge is a powerful force . in women just as much as men .
grandpa . my father . it's his .
shh !
my dad gave shelly a ring .
never touch the stuff . i've got friends all over the world . good friends i can see when i want , if i want .
no , he didn't .
yes , she takes care of the garden .
eight and a half ?
actually , mel does his own ass work . why wouldn't he ? it's delicious .
what do we have here , margaret ?
yeah , a little . i think you grew an inch or so . and you've lost weight .
when ! ?
that's no excuse for not going after what you want .
you will notice , though , that there are no more pha@@ ses . only four forms are shown . after that the pattern repeats .
i wouldn't dare answer that .
what , some cheap , gruesome ga@@ gs ?
johnny ...
you knew which man ?
no ... i have a ... room ... at the hotel de per@@ rin .
i'm worried about my spine . i'm very worried about my brain and my spine .
maybe .
a dick , man ! and let me tell you something : i dig your work . playing one side against the other@@ --in bed with every@@ bo@@ d@@ y--@@ fabulous stuff , man .
i checked your release date . i never liked coincidences .
that was five years ago .
it's my head , i'll be the judge of that . anyway , who are you ?
what ? what ?
i want you to come .
now that he's in the real world , there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality . sid is going to evolve .
maybe .
right then .
to the apartment - - it matches mine perfectly .
yes . would you like me to walk a little way with you ?
does she suffer ?
you find people jobs ?
he saw my face too .
nobody meant any harm . the boy was curious . i un@@ loaded the gun -
what i never could figure about the movie ?
ga@@ w , it's depressing in here , isn't it ? funny ... ' cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in england , don't they ? you'd expect something a little more pa@@ la@@ ti@@ al . come on . let's have a little action . let's do something , then .
you're hurting him ! !
what's that , mrs . mulwray ?
well , how nice to see you again , elena . you're looking wonderful .
what the hell was that ? an ape ?
ditto for the s@@ wo@@ op@@ ing swallow .
you shut up !
i'm impatient . look , do you wanna leave a message for someone ?
shush . janet's probably asleep by now . do you want her to see you like this ?
keep it .
from her point of view or mine ?
you said there'd be a thousand dollar reward .
every valuable item in the house was on that list .
thanks .
oh , now don't get all jealous , ed . i got a little something for you , too .
we won't let him get hurt , ma'am .
you have the right to speak to an at@@ t - -
it's a long way to go for a date .
in here . with us .
very good , steed ...
oh ?
you weren't dreaming about me .
fifty percent off , motherfucker . ho ho ho .
almost ne@@ gli@@ gi@@ ble ... with variation of parameters , this is the answer .
you know what that creep and his fro@@ g@@ faced foot@@ men are calling me <u> now </u> ? in front of the whole <u> world </u> ? fro@@ sty , the snow bitch ! !
don't you think his girl friend's beautiful ?
i cant stay here .
i don't think you're going to do that .
just a suggestion , but perhaps we should flee .
thirty seconds ? isn't that cutting it a little too close ?
maybe .
i might've smelled like a sewer , but you could tell i was a gentleman . they say john dillinger was a pretty nice guy .
yeah , yeah , yeah . you remember ?
what's that--@@ detour ?
actually i'm feeling up to leaving .
- - but , in here , in everyone , there's the squ@@ int of a five-@@ day headache . yet they forced themselves to be positive . they never said " parasite ; " they said " agent . " they always talked about getting better .
come here , come here .
it's too late for him , and soon it'll be too late for all of us .
how much do you think you'll need ?
i'll go check on brenda .
whether or not i'm going .
go on--@@ give ' em to your friends .
you want me to stay ?
report to dr . in@@ n@@ is at the clinic .
the situation is , my man cameron here has a major jones for bianca stratford .
and code the signal to my private chamber .
it was a long time ago , daniel . we were young , different people , heading in different directions . that's all .
well , after all , it's my apartment - - it's private property - - it's not a public playground .
what's going on , cynthia ?
what do you want ?
it's a surprise . you like surprises , don't you , white ?
no .
of course not , but such violence of feeling makes me wonder .
what's there to be fair about ?
no . i don't think they all did what i did .
- - great : we can watch domini sleep for hour@@ s--@@ or , shit , maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days , maybe a de@@ er@@ 'll dash by !
don't you see ? i had to make it right . i ignored my mother's crossing . i sat with them all . i held their hands . i stro@@ ked their hair . i was with them to the end . i took away the blood . i washed them . their crossing was peaceful .
i will .

that's right and i'll smash your face for you , y@@ ar@@ blo@@ ck@@ os . slide of watch shop .
i hear they're closing that post down .
god , i don't know what it was called . i never saw it . i only got twenty - five bucks for the whole goddamned thing .
that does put a da@@ mp@@ er on our relationship .
if we don't hand you over , everybody in the se@@ ct@@ or@@ 'll be dead by morning .
i told you , the octopus is made of rubber . this is a piece o ' cake .

there's a sand barricade up ahead ; i'm going to ram this cab into it . the cab has an air@@ bag , odds are good i'll survive . but with this steel casing and bullet proof glass , odds for you are not so good .
everybody loves lisa . everybody loves lisa . but everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend .

good evening , monsieur .
uh huh .

that's an after-@@ market alarm . can't just cut her wires ...

i kind of like you tellin ' me what to do and not to do . just like my daddy . i didn't mind him tellin ' me . i hate doyle to tell me what to do . mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us . that we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her .
childs ! that a fuse ?

... you know , that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship .
suga . go ahead and get us something to smoke on .
because i knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip . but then i figured here would be the best place to tell you . we're here to forget about all that shit . we're here to party !

i'll find some copy . be right back .
i'm going to go down and check on puff . see how he's holding up .
you mean you're ready to give up ?
you kill me , mama .
who told you that ?
- - yeah .
why are you so interested ?
what's happened ?
evening . table for one ?
no !
not lately . but maybe someday .

the truth is that it was an accident , and no one's to blame .
forget it .

your family just met me .
i understand .
you are not alone . but you are in@@ con - pi@@ cu@@ ous ... and , with our abilities ...
because you should be home with nintendo , listening to the spice girls , little man ...
i dabble in p@@ har@@ ma@@ ce@@ uti@@ cals , medical research . we've developed a type of sun-@@ blo@@ cker using o@@ ct@@ yl sali@@ cy@@ late , a few others things .
colonel , imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-@@ led armies having at each other . there must be gentlemen in command to lead and , when appropriate , restrain their men .
but have them wait for me ' till they move in on him .
well there's a reason why that mascot isn't a stallion anymore .
look , john . something terribly imp@@ or@@ t@@ ant's happened . they're forming john doe clubs . we know of eight already and they say that there's going
the gunshot holds no fear .
let's walk the route .

i'm staying here .
shhh ! liar .
uh-huh . mom says i have your eyes and your - -
then your father's a wimp .
we're waiting on carmine .

it's me , rollo lin@@ sky . remember me ?
what about night ?
no ... that's the sound of the men working on the chain gang .
yeah , if i cooperate .
of course not . but she's have to know eventually .
he tells me he can give us an exit visa , but we have no money .
yes . the pressures you feel , and again , i am neither la@@ be@@ ling nor judging them , are keeping you from fulfilling your potential - - you're in a rut . so stop the tom fo@@ ol@@ ery - - the sh@@ en@@ ani@@ gan@@ 's , will .
i nu@@ ttin ' to do w@@ i ' dat .
why sir ?
look , i know this chick niki . she works at les girls . she would know . honest .

that won't start no more fires . we mi@@ gh@@ t's well go home .
range 3000 meters and closing .
i didn't know if it was a trick . they might arrest me and throw me in a gu@@ lag . i am hun@@ gary's most famous emi@@ grant . they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave .
this is just a test . the big one comes later . be careful with that though , it's all i got .
i wish . you and i are taking a squad up to ramelle on a public relations mission .
you did what ?
and as a father , i worry about him . in medieval stories , agent myers , there's often a young knight , inexperienced but pure of heart ...
no . here .
it was nobody's fault .

what are they doing ?
i'm so glad we're having this chat .
understood , sir . we need to step up the over@@ flights , fin@@ alize our pilots ' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes .
don't sweat it , okay . sooner or later the tru@@ th@@ 'll come out .
on your six - - coming hard . four hundred . losing air@@ speed ! he's on your six and closing fast ! hard left ! hard left !

no , but at least i wonder sometimes - - instead of doing that " one for one " song of yours . you sound like a sleep@@ teacher with a stuck tape .
the very same .
shhh ... i really need to get some sleep .
so , what , you liked it because it was shiny ?
well , hello there , hon@@ e@@ y-@@ pie .
i'd be delighted . now that you know the way ...

if i'm lucky . so ... i won't be back until the first . your dad will be back on sunday , so i've put elizabeth in charge until then . she has the car ... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow .
is that why she left you ?

what an excellent day for an exorcism .
that's good . i like to watch , too .
yes .
let her go .
same , more of the same . yep , just keep doing the same thing all the time , around and around the clock . with an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy . then , instead of watching gi@@ lli@@ gan , we'd watch captain kirk .
are you still coming ?
no .
she's only known the guy a few months .
look , what do you want me to say ? i was there . i believed him .
shut ...
sorry , mom !
yes , captain .

i'll try to slip out . if he qui@@ e@@ ts down , passes out ... i'm afraid he thinks well , he said you were a buffoon , barton . he becomes irrational
it's you ... it's you ...

you can believe that if you want . i talk to guys like you , and i want to commit suicide . you get that weigh@@ t-@@ lifting set i sent you ?

who are you ?
they're fine . everybody else ... is fine .

he had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight . lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17 . all he did day and night was play the violin .

henry lee lucas . well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred .
what ?
what is it , laurie ?
i figured , whenever you decided to go , you'd be all set .
because , you know , you seem so distant . and you work late every night . and we hardly ever have sex , and when we do , it's ... i don't know . it feels different .
what ?
yes .
well , there's several ways to go .
well . there's the bible story . god took a rib from adam and made eve . maybe men chase women to get the rib back . when god took the rib , he left a hole there , place where there used to be something . and the women have that . maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman .
come on !
whe@@ w@@ w@@ ww ! you sure keep my mind jumping , boy !
i recall distinctly the detonation order . my memory is good on matters like these .
don't test me , you wanna talk about what the law book says , we can do that , push me far enough and i'll take you to jail - - now calm down .

i lied . to her . she thought she'd seen you .
my parents are going to wonder where i am .
i should think a taste of freedom is enough , don't you ? or would you prefer jail ?
yes , we call them that too . ahhh , here we are , lovebirds ...
ignorant , du@@ ll@@ witted , lazy , and unlucky .
i'll have a talk with her . by the way , you never said anything about last night ...

the b - 9 is like a slow child , sir . and data , in his own way , has assumed the position of a parent or guardian . i'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences . he'll be disappointed when the bi - 9 cannot meet those expectations .
i know what he'll say . he'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that i should forget about it . he'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind " for my own good . "
this is a great young out-of-@@ work actress .
then who's russell nash ?
well , as long as people are still having promi@@ scu@@ ous sex with many anonymous partners without protection , while at the same time experimenting with mind-@@ expanding drugs in a con@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ ce-@@ free environment , i'll be sound as a pound .

you must be very proud of what you and your mother have created .
i think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance . for what lady could live up to it close to , when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine ? besides , can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a bank@@ side poet and player ?
there's no way to know . v'ger expected it to be a machine - - some single entity . all of us here may be reduced into patterns ...

she's tied to me , r . l .. we tied to each other .
my life was shaped because someone invented gun@@ powder . our lives have crossed because two lions went mad . but what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity ? was that worth all the lives ? too soon to tell .
that's just the first year . if you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year , i'll kick you out . what do you say ?

alvy , uh , let's face it . you know something , don't think our relationship is working .
the railroad has no business in tennessee . therefore i have no interest in the state of tennessee .
why are you here ?
i've since changed my mind . i designed this place , based on my belief that i was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do . mccay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills . it's a tax write off . on the books everything looks kosher . i have an office on 5th that i haven't seen in ten years .
i don't know ...

all i'm asking is thirty days more . . .
then ask the butler - or someone .
i think you're sweet .
um ... yes .
jesus christ ... <u> that </u> was the judge ?
yes .
no , i don't think you're like , " i'm charming and mysterious in a way that even i don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you " . very hard to compete with . especially to us married women who have lost our mystery .
this road , it leads straight to kuwait .
yes you have . you were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss .
we cain't do that , daddy , we might offend our con@@ sti@@ ch@@ ency .
non@@ ot really .
... so when your dad said , " i never want to see your " f-@@ '@@ in ' faces again ! " do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up ?
my equipment doesn't crap out ...
i know who she is . take a message .
please hold the line ... no such number is assigned .

now , here's how it's gonna be , lydia . you're gonna take your threats and your ac@@ ry@@ lic nails , and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage , instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do , understand ?
so you did fuck up .
he's nothing but a hypocrite . he prea@@ ches morality every day in his sordid little papers for everyone else in the world but he lives openly with his mistress .

i guess what i'm trying to say is - - i'd like us to be friends .
they say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin ' the other day .
right .
and what happened ?
every variable but yourself . you don't eat , sleep . you can't live in your head like - -

she won't have no problems ' cause she don't know nothin ' .
look . when you can see his fingers , it's 50 meters . when you just see his hands , it's about 80 meters . when you di@@ stin@@ gu@@ i@@ sh arms from body , it's 1@@ 20@@ -@@ 130 . when you see nothing more than a shape , you don't shoot . not very sure . you have one chance out of five to miss . a contract means getting all chances on your side . 5 out of 5 . you can't miss a client . never ... if the task is delicate or the risk is too big , you double . that is , you insure yourself by another means .
no ... no .
right . why ?
i'm ready !
sir , i have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom - -
you'll think you're still at the convent .
... you are trying to reassure me because you know when people get anxious , they make mistakes . you're worried about me . do not be . i am careful . i am cool . i got trudy , backup , whatever . you worry about you . because you are the ones who are in denied territory , not me . if your focus is on me , you'll miss something coming at you . that's how people slip up . get hurt . and i'd die if anything happened . you worry about <u> you </u> . you and sonny ... are in the dangerous place . i'm fine ...
in time you will meet them all .
isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog ?
jack , are you okay ?
well ... they get a sort of han@@ g@@ dog expression .
you're tellin ' him what he wants to hear , but that ain't the same thing as kissin ' his ass .
it's alright , baby .
gee , i don't think . . .
then why are you so obsessed with her ? you're losing sleep over her ? you're thinking about her all the time . you're bent on saving her . why ?

i'm going to sleep in my bed . come on , lovey !
i'm workin ' here , rae . can you see that ?
people more serious about their work . you know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it ?
i hear the humming . like electricity . high voltage maybe .
what does that have to do with anything ? does it explain the bar@@ ri@@ ca@@ ded subway stations ? does it explain those godforsaken creatures ?
alice who ?
i'll be your win@@ ger .

i ... i ... we need cash , james .
yes . great . kevin , i ' 11 send bean in to keep you company .

maybe we should say somethin ' .
millie here used to serve drinks to these gun@@ running tru@@ ckers , real big tal@@ kers , talking bout a real score one day . i was in the mountain , man , what the hell , why not let her get friendly with ' em ? let her tell ' em an idea she had , ' bout writing guys in prison . getting one who could show ' em a sure thing .

the boys are back in town ! ! !
yeah , like ...
i command you , as king of the britons to stand aside .
did god make you the sa@@ cker of peaceful cities ? the executioner of the king's nephew , my husband's own cousin ?

she's with her grandmother . she's with ste@@ ph@@ 's mom . she spends a lot of time over there . ste@@ ph@@ 's ... well , she's stephanie .

watts . those were his keys nell found . his roommate called and said watts left when he was supposed to . i think he's here .
you put your disease in me . your semen . it's hot and full of disease .
the zoo . what are you waiting for ?
you don't talk to me like that .
why ? you're not a real man ?
then we'd stay home and eat venison or something , and look through the scra@@ p@@ books . i've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and ca@@ ri@@ bo@@ u meat . i'm going to bring that boy back .
it's just a matter of time .

big pen@@ i-@@ god@@ dam@@ -@@ ci@@ llin bargain , right ?
not a thing .
i mean , who the hell cares about this pen@@ n@@ y-@@ ante shit . goldwater put it right . he said : " well for christ's sake , everybody bugs everybody else ; we know that . " ... it's the cover-up , not the deed that's really bad here . if only mitchell could step up and take the brun@@ t of it ; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course . that's the tragedy of all this . mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway . it's time he assumed some responsibility .
answer my question . did lamar bur@@ ge@@ ss know about the minority report ?
we'll send for the police !

someone needs to grow up . i won't take it , jack .
he isn't .

what is this ? a whole new train ?
i'm working , bandit . besides , what's the matter ? won't your new girl friend help you ?
now that's a question . i don't know about your mom . for me , the problem isn't in the glass . the prob@@ le@@ m's in between my ears .
if you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again ...

i don't want the fuckin ' money ! i'm not gonna give up everything i got for a lousy 50,000 dollars . it's <u> you </u> . you <u> grace </u> or nothing . the whole thing ... i want you to be my wife ... what do you way grace ?
can you not go yourself .
or a vampire .
oh , read it !
you thought i meant ... too tough to apologize , huh ? you must have been a very lonely girl .
put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a por@@ tho@@ le - -
okay--@@ that's enough !
who's baxter ?
it's true , sir , the water has been turned off .
it strikes me that ev@@ e's dis@@ loyalty and in@@ gratitude must be contagious !

no . someone else . a girl . i'm not sure she was ... real .

oh , but you do , kundun . who else would be here ?
wreck is a harsh term . disturbed is more like it . mildly disturbed even .

the money isn't here .
it's just me . i want to talk to you . let me in ...

you don't think that's crazy ?
galley proof .
i know . i don't either .
but ... we bury the heads . oh . god ! it must be torture for them !
you may never remember at all . [ beat ] your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged .
her blood is all over the bathroom . i'd say that's a bit of a dna problem .
good morning !

that's right .
from here on in you want something you pay cash for it : no credit cards , no bank accounts are in place : ten percent up front , the rest when the job is done . you . what do you do and what should we call you ?

my name's gil@@ roy . i'm from the state certification board .

i just know how you get . good to know , them butterflies still in ya gut .
who ?
not so fast .
forget it .
you killed him ?
you're absolutely right . you forgot to mention their nuclear subs . but it wouldn't matter . sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mu@@ ssed , but we'd prevail . i don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people , tops .
what is this , your farewell speech ?
do you ? even assuming you're able to prevent ambrose selling chimera , you've now got an additional problem . you destroyed all of chimera at biocyte . if ambrose is going to sell chimera now , he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of miss ha@@ ll's blood to market .
huh ? what'd he say ?
we got but four days to get to that treasure ! after that , it'll be at the bottom of a lake !
was there burger king ?
i'm going to vancouver , mr . mitchell .

information , baby . i thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience .
sucks for you .
anything .
who would want to do such a thing as that ?
well , i don't have no trousers on ...
yes , but important people are concerned about this . judge hi@@ lli@@ er spoke to alma styles - -
we did not .
standard orbit , mr . sulu .
i admit , that's a very hard thing to do . quickly let's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sp@@ on@@ sor@@ s , da bomb . 1@@ 25 % pure pleasure malt liquor . it makes you wanna get ya freak on and ti@@ mm@@ i hi@@ ll@@ nigger . 1@@ 25 % authentic git@@ -@@ toe gear when you want to be git@@ -@@ to@@ ed fabulous .
so i just take your word ?
hello , bill .
he backed down .
wish i could help , sheriff . but if you'll excuse me i'm going over to harlin's to pick up my car . then i'm getting the hell out of this place .
i don't know if i can say that .
then what are we going through all this trouble for ?
jim we cant .

yeah , i know .
you could save him , little bird .
how you guys doing ?
left ? when ? i just come from his place and there was no one there . a ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ our of his ...
i understand . i saw you in the theatre , your suffering , your sympathy for that girl . i saw you with the boy . you die when you kill , you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing . but does that make you evil ? or , since you comprehend what you call goodness , does it not make you good ?
i can do it myself .
who's there ?
oh , that v@@ ry@@ ko@@ la@@ ka business . you mustn't be too angry with him , thea . he's an old man and now with all this trouble the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory - - cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village .
he thinks you want him to look at evidence .
bullshit ! she was alive when we left her with you .
oh , yeah . i had mr . dee@@ gan .
you better give me something , dad . you better give me something mom ?
i don't freak out .

oh , yes ! do that ! you treat me right , man . tell me all about yourself , your roots , your personal life , your childhood dreams ...
she's dead ?
well sir , to be a putterer , one's mind must be at ease . a person with a problem could never be a putterer . for instance , sir , a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place . an eagle can putter around a ru@@ gged moun@@ ta@@ in@@ top but not in a cage , because he'd be restless and unhappy . now sir , if you will pardon me , with all due respect , sir , as a smythe to a smith , you are an eagle in a cage .

sir , the charges are serious - - first , abuse of power ; second , ob@@ st@@ ru@@ ction of justice ; third , failure to cooperate with congress ; and last , bombing cambodia ...
you're shaking .
what are you saying ? that jon is radioactive ?
which one ? let me get the list out .
as for instance ?
how do you like santa carla ?
i thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning ?
i'll bet just while we were talking , you made like a hundred thousand dollars .
because she's an innocent . she's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by god .
for pulling a 210 - pound man out of a burning barrack in saudi ar@@ ab@@ ia .
my father !
we'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning .
you try to be a good sport , and look what happens .

no rest for the wicked .
well thank you , hun . that's real good of you to say . i wouldn't know what to do without him either .
we're getting married . she said she could tell i was a great artist she could see it in my eyes . she said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-@@ racial babies with me .
grant - - wait a minute - - you're not going to dis@@ man@@ tle the wireless ?

what's the difference ?
how come everyone thinks hitting me's the best way to get my attention ?
yes , sir . i'll brace myself .

it's his life insurance money , you know .
i might understand that .
no one saw me but the italian and a dog . i blew up their generator . they thought it was an accident but by now they must have rea@@ li@@ sed one of their party is missing . it might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up ...
so he di@@ d--@@ but he hasn't told you what he saw . i have .
four fu@@ lls , one half . that mean we're halfway there ? i hope ?
skiing ?

but - - how can you just live for what you want ? what about other people ?
i'd like that .
we had an awful lot of shooting . you need a doctor in there ?
i <u> know </u> . i just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful ground@@ work i've laid up till now .

you didn't tell him about me ?
