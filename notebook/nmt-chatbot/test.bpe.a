what's wrong ? $ nothing . $ what murders ?
well , sir , i'm afraid they said you're over@@ drawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled . $ unbelievable . look ... here . i don't know what's going on . that's so much baloney . i've got enough cash for one night , okay ?
are you all there ?
you gonna jump ? or are you just having a last look ? $ i was just thinking that i never had a new pair of shoes till i was twelve . $ it's not a vacation , it's private school .
hello , tom . $ you here again ? what do you want ?
rex . go away . i don't want to have to sic the dogs on you .
look ... would it be possible to make the " ghoul's wife " a little less prominent , so people won't really notice me in the movie ?

i haven't seen one dollar from you . you haven't paid me one cent in child support , alimony . $ yeah , well . i'm working on that . i've got something going .
you know how i feel about what you do . $ could we change the subject ? $ that record company@@ .@@ in nashville wants to hear my demo tape .
fuck ! fuck you fucking guys ! $ well we can definitely call the police . that's an easy call . if we call the police ... what happens ? they find a dead prostitute in the bathroom ... they ask us ... what happened ? we say , ah ... our friend , micheal ... your brother ... got a little out of control ... they were making love ... and he got a little excited ... and he , ah , sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet , while he choked her to death with a rubber hose ... $ oh god . this is insane .

hey--@@ joe ! where you going ? we've got to celebrate tonight !
what happened ? i'm sorry , sir , i must have taken a bad step ... $ can you stand ? we've got to get out of here before those tu@@ sk@@ ens come back .

i think that we should spend some time apart .
no response . i'm not reading any starfleet com traffic in this entire sector . $ captain , i've scanned the planet . the atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane , carbon mono@@ xi@@ de and flu@@ or@@ ine . the oceans have been chemi@@ cally altered , as well . $ captain , they're firing at a nuclear missile silo ... in central montana .

... maybe you should talk to somebody , darling .
no . $ are you going to graduate school ? $ no .
i can take care of myself , jeffrey . $ so i noticed . $ so that's your tutor , huh ? what is he , like , your boyfriend now ?
let's go . $ no . $ what you mean , no ?
he needs professional help . i think we should take him to a psychiatrist .
how long has it been ? $ since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word ?
what are you babbling about , psycho ? $ i want to know what's going on . are you part of this ?
my daddy ain't never killed nobody , has he , mama ?
john . john ...
did i ever tell you to eat up ? go to bed ? wash your ears ? do your homework ? no . i respected your privacy and i taught you self-@@ reliance . $ what you taught me was that i was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country . and i learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years .
... but there is worse . he ordered the execution of five members of the nobility ...
this is tom ripley . freddie miles . $ hey , if i'm late , think what her husband's saying ! $ dick - - you've got to hear this !

forget it . it doesn't matter .
so - - how long will you be gone this time ?
it is . it's what you hired us for . nobody touched your money . nobody stole anything . they're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne ... all your friends ... it's a celebration ... $ no ...
you're right . $ there you go . love you . $ me too .
you're right ! we'll take a trip . a trip is what we'll take . i don't want to talk about motorcycles . i don't want to talk about tits . go home !

one day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest , a great storm blew up out of nowhere . but so passionate was their singing that they did not notice , nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch ... and at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb ! she - never@@ -@@ spo@@ ke-@@ another@@ -@@ word . $ ohhh ... dear . not another word from the shock , yes it would be . $ well , that is a strong opinion .

all right . $ play it tough . that's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it . don't lie to helms and say there's no involvement , but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors , bizarre , without getting into it . say the president believes it's going to open up the whole bay of pigs thing again . tell helms he should call the fbi , call pat gray , and say that we wish for the sake of the country - - don't go any further into this hanky-panky , period !
what're you doing here ?

to be perfectly honest with you , doug , if outer space is your thing , i think you'd be much happier with one of our saturn cru@@ i@@ se@@ s@@ .@@ everybody raves about ' em .

i teach these classes i've taught for a million years . the spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago . i started off , i was excited about something and i wanted to share it . now it's rote , it's the multi@@ pli@@ cation table . except sometimes . sometimes i'm droning along and i look up , and there's this fresh young beautiful face , and it's all new to her and i'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud . and when that happens , when i look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face , and see me there in her eyes , me the way i always wanted to be and maybe once was , then i ask her out on a date . it doesn't last . it can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months , but then she catches on that i'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini . and at that moment , she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face , or some action to that effect .
there is nothing to discuss .
what happened ?
the water was dripping , see ... i turned it off , but it was still dripping , and then auggie had to go out , and so i left the back room ... and later on ... well , later on ... when auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded . his cuban cigars got all messed up ... you know , soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits ... $ cuban cigars . you mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys ? $ i suppose so . he never told me about it .
did you even to try to negotiate ? $ these guys ain't spic fire@@ cracker salesman from tijuana . they don't even know the meaning of the word " barter " . you wanna stay in el ray ? you give them thirty percent of your loot . it's scripture . so it is written , so shall it be done . you want sanctuary , you pay the price , and the price is thirty percent . $ - - this conversation is over .

what ? $ i'll come back if you like , but i'm not promising anything . $ do you find that this approach usually works , or , let me guess , you've never tried it before . in fact , you don't normally approach girls , am i right ? the truth is that you're a quite , sensitive type but if i'm prepared to take a chance i might just get to know the inner you : witty , adventurous , passionate , loving , loyal , a little bit crazy , a little bit bad , but , hey , don't us girls just love that ?

yes , we'd like to get moving . $ why don't you go on . we'll meet you at the clearance desk in a few minutes . $ grant's uniquely qualified for this mission . he's a communications expert and was a fro@@ gman during the war . besides , he brought benes into this country , and the fewer people who know about him , the better . at any rate , you'll find grant invaluable , should anything go wrong once you're under way . okay , don .

why are you running away ?
i never got lost . for some reason , i'm more at home everywhere than at one place . so i decided i'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen . i belong everywhere and nowhere . i'm kin to everyone , and no one in particular . see , once you get into the habit of not needing anyone , it's kind of hard to break . $ you must get lonely at times .
you can trust me . $ good , so then you could tell me what the money is for . $ you remember when you called him that night ? when you said goodbye to him ? he didn't say , ' don't get married , i'll be right down , we'll get married . ' he didn't say that to you , did he ?

when i get set , i'll send for you . $ i don't think that'll happen .
twenty years i've led men to die . for me it was the glory of rome . but that was something . if it wasn't that , then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore - - but that was something ! these men here are butchered for laughs ! their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line !

you probably even called us bea@@ vers on your cb radio , didn't you ? $ yeah ... sure did .

neighborhood watch ? is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations ? $ these ain't strangers , they're neighbors . this only picks up signals in a half-mile radius . $ meaning ?
you're fucked , sami . you know it . that's why you're here .
no shit . they had me by the balls . next thing i know i'm in saigon ... in a secret lab synthe@@ sizing mind - altering drugs . not the street stuff mind you . they had us isolating special properties . the dark side , you know ? they wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies .

i don't say he was a man like an earth@@ man , but i'd call him a close relative , for he was plagued by most of man's ills . yet , fragile as he was , he came before you - - and was superior to you . $ that's lunacy . i can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inven@@ tive as yours . but it would be conjecture , not proof . $ tell him to pull back !
you're looking fine , major . $ now see here , my good man . i've had just about enough of your insulting remarks !

why do guys always know how to hit a woman ? right across the cheek , wham , so it feels like your eye is gonna explode . what do they do , take you all aside in high school and show you how ? it pisses me off ! $ not all men hit . and no one is going to hit you anymore . $ right . you're quite the sir galahad today , aren't ya ' ? i heard what you did with kross .
how many men you killed ? ain't you gonna answer ?
don't you feel there are different sides to every personality ? maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act . we're all human . $ it's hard for me to see stargher as human , capable of something like " remorse . "
